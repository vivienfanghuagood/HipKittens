# RDNA hardware probes

Standalone HIP programs that measure what the RDNA3 / RDNA4 port is built on.
They do not use the library (except where noted) and they do not need it to be
correct — that is the point. When something in `include/rdna3` or
`include/rdna4` disagrees with the hardware, these are what tell you which side
is wrong.

```bash
./build.sh wmma_layout.hip gfx1100        # compile
./wmma_layout                              # run on the card
./build.sh mma_gate.hip gfx1201 --asm      # or just look at the ISA
./run_features.sh gfx1201                  # compile-probe the feature matrix
```

`build.sh <file.hip> [arch] [--asm]` — `arch` is `gfx1100` or `gfx1201` and sets
`-DKITTENS_RDNA3` / `-DKITTENS_RDNA4`. `--asm` stops at assembly, which is how
the gfx12 claims were checked without a gfx12 card.

## What each one establishes

| | |
|---|---|
| `wmma_layout.hip` | **The foundational measurement.** One-hot probes plus gauge analysis, recovering the physical register layout of every WMMA operand and accumulator. Everything in `rt_base_coord()` comes from here. Has a `PROBE_GFX12_W32` variant, written but never run. |
| `features.hip` + `run_features.sh` | The hardware feature matrix — `vmem-to-lds`, `s_setprio`, `sched_group_barrier`, `permlane*`, WMMA variants, SWMMAC, and the maximum static LDS allocation, found by bisecting the compiler error. |
| `mma_gate.hip` | Phase 3 gate: does the `rt_base` layout derivation agree with real WMMA output, for a single 16×16×16 and for blocked GEMMs. |
| `mem_gate.hip` | Phase 4 gate: every memory path round-tripped — global↔shared, global↔register, shared↔register, tiles and vectors, both layouts. |
| `red_gate.hip`, `conv_gate.hip` | Phase 5 gates: tile reductions, and the layout conversions that have to move data across the wave halves. |
| `srsrc.hip`, `srsrc2.hip`, `srsrc3.hip` | How the gfx10+ buffer resource descriptor actually behaves. CDNA's `0x110000` config word is a gfx9 format; these sweep word 3 against in-bounds and out-of-bounds accesses and land on `0x31004000`, valid for gfx11 and gfx12 both. |
| `wmma_peak.hip` | **The performance denominator.** Back-to-back `v_wmma_f32_16x16x16_bf16` with no memory access in the inner loop, over a sweep of independent accumulator chains. Measures 100.5 TFLOPs on a W7900D at a sampled 2.18 GHz, against a spec-sheet 122.6 that assumes 2.495 GHz boost. Flat from `ACC=2` to `ACC=16`, so it is an issue-rate ceiling, not a latency artifact. Every "% of peak" in this tree is taken against this number. |
| `lds_peak.hip` | **The other denominator.** LDS delivered bandwidth under the exact access patterns a GEMM inner loop uses, reported in bytes/clk/CU so it can be compared directly against what a kernel's inner loop demands. Seven patterns, same instruction count each. The one that matters is `ST`, which reproduces `st<bf16,128,32>::idx()` addressing including the XOR swizzle: it measures 64.8 B/clk/CU, tied with a hand-constructed conflict-free reference and 4.1x an unswizzled tile read. That is the evidence that the rdna3 swizzle constant is right. |
| `empty.hip` | The minimal "does the toolchain work for this target" file. |

## Do not measure against the spec sheet

The W7900 data sheet says 122.6 TFLOPs bf16, which is 96 CU x 512 FLOP/clk x
2.495 GHz. Sampling `rocm-smi` during each workload says the card does not get
there and cannot:

| workload | sclk | power | TFLOPs |
|---|---|---|---|
| `wmma_peak.hip` (no memory at all) | 2181 MHz | 101 W | 100.5 |
| rocBLAS GEMM 4096^3 | 2089 MHz | 227 W | 86.4 |
| hipBLASLt GEMM 4096^3 | 2062 MHz | 241 W | 68.3 |

The pure-WMMA loop reaches 480 FLOP/clk/CU against the architectural 512, i.e.
the issue rate is 94% of spec; the whole rest of the gap to 122.6 is clock. Add
memory traffic and the card hits its 241 W limit and drops another 100 MHz. So
the reachable peak on this part is ~104 TFLOPs, not 122.6, and a percentage
computed against 122.6 understates a kernel by about 18%.

## One warning, learned the hard way

A gfx11 WMMA operand is **mirrored across the wave halves** — lanes `l` and
`l+16` must hold identical data. The first version of `wmma_layout.hip` set a
one-hot in a single lane without mirroring it to `l^16`. That violates the
hardware constraint, so what came back was undefined behaviour, and it did not
look like garbage: it looked like a coherent layout in which half the lanes
contributed nothing. The probe now sets `l` and `l^16` together, and feeds
operands from global memory so that dynamic `insertelement` codegen cannot
confuse the picture either.

If a probe result surprises you, suspect the probe first.

## What LDS actually delivers

Same instruction count in every row; `bytes/clk/CU` is the comparable column and
`ms` is not, because `U16` moves 2 bytes per lane per instruction where the rest
move 16.

| pattern | bytes/clk/CU | what it is |
|---|---|---|
| `LINEAR` | 27.6 | `lane*16`, fully coalesced across 32 distinct lanes |
| `TILE16` | 15.7 | 16 mirrored lanes at a 64 B row stride, no swizzle -- only banks 0-3 and 16-19 are ever touched, an 8-way conflict |
| `TILE16X` | 15.6 | the same plus the *CDNA* swizzle, which flips address bit 3. A `ds_read_b128` ignores the low four address bits, so this is invisible to it and measures identical to `TILE16`, as it must |
| `XOR4` | 37.7 | 16 B granules permuted within a 64 B row by `row&3`: four bank groups |
| `K64` | 64.4 | the same with a 128 B row and `row&7`: eight bank groups, conflict-free by construction |
| **`ST`** | **64.8** | **what this tree actually does.** `off ^= ((off % 1024) >> 7) << 4` over a 64 B row stride sends sixteen lanes to bank groups 0,16,4,20,8,24,12,28 and then the same eight again -- two lanes per group, the 2-cycle minimum for a 256 B request |
| `U16` | 35.8 | one bf16 per instruction at `lane*2`, K strided 256 B apart. This is what rocBLAS/Tensile does, and it is conflict-free too |

`ST` tying `K64` is the whole point of the table: the LDS reads in this tree are
already conflict-free, and `swizzle_bytes` does not need retuning. Anything left
on the table in the GEMM is bytes moved, not cycles lost to banking.

Read the demand side like this. One HipKittens inner-loop iteration is 24
`ds_read_b128` and 16 WMMAs per wave. The WMMAs are 16 x 8192 FLOP, which at
512 FLOP/clk/CU is 256 CU-cycles, and a CU retires two wave-iterations in that
window, so the LDS has to supply `2 * 24 * 32 * 16 / 512` = **48 bytes/clk/CU**
against a 64.8 ceiling: 74% utilised. rocBLAS's 64x64 warp tile asks for 32 B/clk
for the same 16 WMMAs. That 1.5x is not a banking problem and no swizzle fixes
it; it is `(M*N)/(M+N)` for a 32x64 tile versus a 64x64 one, exactly 21.3 vs 32.
