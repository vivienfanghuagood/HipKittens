"""Phase 2: loops, reductions, in-place writes, fills, scalars.

Pure Python. What is asserted here is the structure the emitter depends on --
that a loop is a region rather than a flattened sequence, that an accumulating
reduction writes its own destination instead of declaring a new one, that a
fill's index is a runtime value. Each of those being wrong produces a kernel
