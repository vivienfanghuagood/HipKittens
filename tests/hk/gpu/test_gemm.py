"""Numerics for the DSL GEMM: does the generated kernel compute A @ B.T.

Needs a Radeon and torch. The resource half of the Phase 3 gate -- ScratchSize
0, no spill, the same occupancy as the handwritten kernel -- is checked at
build time and so runs on the no-GPU tier. This file is the other half, and it
is the one that can catch what the gates cannot: a kernel that reads the wrong
subtile spills nothing, occupies the same registers, and is wrong.

Why the shapes below are what they are. The schedule has three places an index
can be wrong in a way no single shape exposes:

  * the L2 swizzle (WGM) only does anything once there is more than one
    block-row, so M has to exceed 128 and the shapes have to be non-square;
  * the backing-up M remainder only runs when M is not a multiple of 128, and
    when it does it makes two workgroups recompute an overlapping strip --
    which is only safe if they write identical bytes;
  * the K loop's prologue and epilogue are separate code from its body, so a
    shape with a single K-tile exercises neither rotation nor staging.
