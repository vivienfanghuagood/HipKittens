 * @brief Granule-decomposed LDS addressing for 16x16 operand fragments.
 *
 * `load`/`store` on a shared tile form one full VGPR address per ds_read_b128.
 * That is the right default when a kernel touches a tile or two.  A kernel that
 * reads dozens of fragments out of the *same* tile inside a loop cannot afford
 * it: every one of those addresses is loop-invariant, LLVM hoists them all, and
 * they spill.  The decomposition below collapses them to `swizzle_bytes/16`
 * registers per tile by moving the whole fragment-coordinate dependence into
 * ds_read_b128's 16-bit immediate offset, where it costs no register at all.
 *
 * Found in kernels/rdna3/attn/fwd/attn.cpp; the derivation and the exhaustive
 * check against `st::idx` are in the comment below.

// ---- LDS addressing for the two hot matmuls --------------------------------
//
// The library's load() forms one full VGPR address per ds_read_b128.  That is
// the right default for a tile or two.  In the attention forward kernel it is
// fatal: the QK and PV loops between them issue 128 reads whose addresses are every one of them
// loop-invariant, so LLVM hoists 128 addresses out of the KV loop and then
// spills most of them.  Measured, on the version that used load():
//
//     91 scratch_store, all in the loop preheader, none in the body
//     87 scratch_load,  all in the body
//     every spilled value is `v_add_nc_u32 v0, s6|s7, vN`  -- an LDS address
//
// 372 bytes/lane of scratch, and in a kernel that hand-manages s_waitcnt a
// spill is a correctness bug, not a slowdown.
//
// Those 128 addresses collapse to nine, because st::idx is affine in almost all
// of its arguments.  Write SB for the tile's swizzle_bytes and SUB = SB/2 for
// its subtile_cols.  Then for any 2-byte tile with SB >= 64,
//
//     idx(ptr, {R + l, c}) = idx(ptr, {l, 8*((c % SUB) / 8)})    <- lane, SB/16 of them
//                          + (c / SUB) * rows * SB + SB * R      <- compile-time
//
// for l in 0..15 and R a multiple of 16.  Two facts make it true.  The swizzle
// key is bits 7..9 of the tile-relative offset and both dropped terms are
// multiples of 1024, so neither perturbs the key -- which is what lets them
// leave the XOR and become addends.  And the swizzle is a permutation of
// 16-byte granules *within* a row, so the lane-dependent part takes SB/16
// values, one per granule, however wide the tile is and however many fragments
// are read out of it.
//
// SB >= 64 is the real precondition, not an artifact: at SB = 32 the row stride
// is small enough that 16 rows reach bit 9, the key changes with R, and the row
// term stops being constant.  A 32-byte swizzle means a 16-column tile, which
// nothing here stages.
//
// So: SB/16 granule addresses computed once, and the entire (R, c) dependence
// moves into ds_read_b128's 16-bit offset field, where it costs no register at
// all.  Checked exhaustively against st::idx over every (rows, cols, R, l, c)
// with SB >= 64 up to 256x256.
