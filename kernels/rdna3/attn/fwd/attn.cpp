//
// The shape of this kernel is not a port of the CDNA4 one; it is what the
// gfx11 register layouts leave you with.  Three facts drive every decision:
//
//   * The WMMA accumulator is `col` layout, and a *reduction along the element
//     axis* is register-local while one along the lane axis is a four-step
//     butterfly (see the table at the top of reductions.cuh).  For a col-layout
//     accumulator the element axis is the *row* axis.  So if the score matrix is
//     stored transposed -- S^T, indexed [kv, q] -- then the online softmax's max
//     and sum over kv land on the cheap axis, and the running statistics are one
//     VGPR each.
//
//   * Only `row`-layout bf16 operand tiles take the vectorized ds_read_b128 path
//     out of LDS (shared_to_register.cuh).  A `col`-layout one degrades to 16
//     scalar ds_read_u16 per base tile.  So every operand that comes out of LDS
//     must be row layout, which fixes which mma_* primitive each matmul uses.
//
//   * A row/col operand pair is bit-identical on gfx11 (the note above
//     mma_ABt_base), so choosing between mma_AB / mma_ABt / mma_AtBt is free --
//     they all lower to the same v_wmma_f32_16x16x16_bf16.  The choice is purely
//     about which layout tag the tiles get to carry.
//
// Which gives:
//
//     S^T[kv,q]  = K . Q^T      mma_ABt(s_t, k, q)     k row (LDS) ✓  q row ✓
//     O^T[d,q]  += V^T . P^T    mma_AB (o_t, vt, p_t)  vt row (LDS) ✓  p_t col
//
// O is accumulated transposed for the same reason S is: the rescale factor and
// the final 1/l are per-q, and on O^T[d,q] "per-q" is per-column, which takes
// the same ortho row-vector the softmax already produced.  Keeping O as [q,d]
// would need the same statistic in the *other* vector layout and a conversion
// between them every KV block.  The one transpose this costs is paid once per
// Q block in the epilogue, not once per KV block.
//
// V^T is what the second matmul needs and V arrives [n, d], so V is transposed
// on the way into LDS -- see stage_vt() below.  There is no way around a
// transpose somewhere: the PV matmul's B operand must have kv on the element
// axis, and a vectorized LDS read always puts the tile's row index on the lane
// axis.  Doing it here means it is paid once per KV block per workgroup rather
// than once per KV block per warp.

// with a single buffer the write has to wait for every wave to finish reading,
// so all NUM_WARPS waves are lockstepped twice per KV block and a SIMD has
// nothing to switch to while one of its waves stages.
//
// With two buffers the commit targets a buffer nobody is reading and the
// mid-block barrier disappears -- one barrier per KV block instead of two.
// Nothing is reordered within a wave (every LDS access here is volatile asm);

// Measured, and off by default: it is worth +1.5-2% causal and -0.5%

// spills most of them.  Measured, on the version that used load():
//
//     91 scratch_store, all in the loop preheader, none in the body
//     87 scratch_load,  all in the body
//     every spilled value is `v_add_nc_u32 v0, s6|s7, vN`  -- an LDS address
//
// 372 bytes/lane of scratch, and in a kernel that hand-manages s_waitcnt a
// spill is a correctness bug, not a slowdown.
//
// Those 128 addresses collapse to nine, because st::idx is affine in almost all
// of its arguments.  Write SB for the tile's swizzle_bytes and SUB = SB/2 for
// its subtile_cols.  Then for any 2-byte tile with SB >= 64,
//
//     idx(ptr, {R + l, c}) = idx(ptr, {l, 8*((c % SUB) / 8)})    <- lane, SB/16 of them
//                          + (c / SUB) * rows * SB + SB * R      <- compile-time
//
// for l in 0..15 and R a multiple of 16.  Two facts make it true.  The swizzle
// key is bits 7..9 of the tile-relative offset and both dropped terms are
// multiples of 1024, so neither perturbs the key -- which is what lets them
// leave the XOR and become addends.  And the swizzle is a permutation of
// 16-byte granules *within* a row, so the lane-dependent part takes SB/16
// values, one per granule, however wide the tile is and however many fragments
// are read out of it.
//
// SB >= 64 is the real precondition, not an artifact: at SB = 32 the row stride
// is small enough that 16 rows reach bit 9, the key changes with R, and the row
// term stops being constant.  A 32-byte swizzle means a 16-column tile, which
// nothing here stages.
//
// So: SB/16 granule addresses computed once, and the entire (R, c) dependence
// moves into ds_read_b128's 16-bit offset field, where it costs no register at
// all.  Checked exhaustively against st::idx over every (rows, cols, R, l, c)
// with SB >= 64 up to 256x256.
