"""gfx1201 -- RDNA4, RX 9070 / W9000-class.

READ THIS AS "WRITTEN, NOT VERIFIED." No gfx12 part was available. The mma
shape is read out of builtin signatures; the register file and LDS sizes are
carried over from gfx11 because nothing contradicted them. The VGPR allocation
granule in particular has NOT been measured here -- on gfx1100 it turned out to
be 24 rather than the 8 everyone assumes, and that was only discovered by
compiling a sweep and diffing against LLVM's occupancy remark.

`verified=False` makes hk.ir.verify report budget violations as warnings rather
than hard errors on this target. A wrong hard limit is worse than no limit.
Before trusting anything here, run tools/rdna-probes on the hardware and the
granule sweep in /kernel-resource-check.
