"""Flash attention forward, written in the DSL.

A transcription of kernels/rdna3/attn/fwd/attn.cpp -- 1237 lines of C++ and
twenty `#define` knobs -- into something a Python caller can retune without a
`make clean`. The gate is parity: same ScratchSize, same occupancy, same
TFLOPs. An IR that can only express the slow attention is an IR nobody will
use for the fast one.

What the schedule is, in one paragraph. One workgroup owns Q_TILE query rows,
Q_BLOCK of them per warp, and never writes them to LDS: Q lives in registers
for the whole kernel. It walks the KV axis in blocks of KV_BLOCK, staging each
block's K straight into LDS and its V *transposed* into LDS, then every warp
multiplies the whole block against its own Q rows. One barrier pair per KV
block.

Three things are stored transposed, and it is the same reason each time.
S is kept as S^T, [kv, q]:

  * its reductions (the running max, the running sum) are then over the
    *element* axis of a col-layout fp32 accumulator -- register-local steps
    plus one cross-half exchange, no butterfly;
  * both statistics are `row_vec`s of S^T, and so is what `mul_col`/`div_col`
    want on the O accumulator, so no vector ever changes layout;
  * the causal predicate becomes one `v_cmp` per element: q is the lane axis
    and kv the element axis, both free.

O follows S^T, so the PV matmul is O^T += V^T . P^T, which is what forces V^T
into LDS -- and that is the third transpose, paid once per block by the stager
rather than once per warp per block by sixteen `ds_read_u16`.

The one thing this file does *not* transpose is the epilogue. The C++ moves the
accumulator's data back to [q, d] with a per-fragment `transpose`; here
`hk.transpose` relabels instead, which is the same transpose for free, because
a base tile's storage does not depend on its layout tag.
