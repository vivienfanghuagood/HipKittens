"""bf16 GEMM with fp32 accumulate, written in the DSL.

A transcription of kernels/rdna3/gemm/bf16fp32/gemm.cpp, which is 995 lines of
C++ and twenty `#define` knobs. The gate for this file is not "it works": it is
that the generated kernel matches the handwritten one on ScratchSize,
occupancy and TFLOPs, because an IR that can only express the slow version of a
kernel is an IR nobody will use for the fast one.

What the schedule is, in one paragraph. The workgroup holds two LDS buffers
each of A (BLOCK_M x K_STEP) and B (BLOCK_N x K_STEP), and alternates between
them. Each K-tile: read operand slices out of the resident buffer and multiply,
then write the *other* buffer from registers that were filled by global loads
issued an iteration ago, then issue the next iteration's loads. One barrier per
K-tile, not two -- the write-after-read hazard on the buffer being overwritten
is already covered by the previous iteration's barrier, so only the
write-before-read hazard needs a fresh one.

Three things the DSL does that the C++ cannot:

  * **The lgkmcnt immediates are derived.** The C++ computes them with a
    constexpr `reads_in_flight()` plus a `TAIL_OPS` term for the interleaved
    ds_writes, and a paragraph explaining why. Here `lds_wait_for` names the
    tiles it retires and `hk.ir.passes.lds_pipeline` walks the issue queue. An
    immediate that is too large does not over-wait, it fails to wait at all --
    so this is the difference between a schedule you can edit and one you can
    only admire.
  * **The operand binding is not optional.** There is no bare `lds_wait` in the
    DSL to reach for.
  * **The spill gate is in the build.** `max_vgprs`/`min_occupancy` below are
    part of compiling this kernel, so a change that costs a wave fails to
    produce a `.so` rather than quietly producing a slower one.

Shapes. B is passed pre-transposed as (N, K): it keeps both shared loads
contiguous and makes `mma_ABt` the right primitive, which is the whole reason
the operand tiles are both row-layout and therefore both on the ds_read_b128
fast path.

    every 64x64 variant either spills or falls to 5-6 waves/SIMD, and the ones
