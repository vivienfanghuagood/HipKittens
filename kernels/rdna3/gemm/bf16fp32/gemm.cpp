// bf16 GEMM with fp32 accumulate for gfx1100 (RDNA3).
//
// Structurally this follows kernels/cdna4/gemm/bf16fp32, but the schedule is
// redesigned for RDNA3, where three things are different:
//
//   * wave32, and a WMMA operand is mirrored across the two wave halves, so a
//     bf16 rt_base costs the same 8 VGPRs as an fp32 one. Operand registers,
//     not accumulator registers, are what bounds the tile here.
//   * no global->LDS DMA. Every byte of a prefetch passes through VGPRs, so a
//     "async copy" is load_global_to_register_buffer now and
//     store_register_buffer_to_shared at the point the buffer is needed.
//   * one XCD, so there is no chiplet swizzle -- only the L2 group swizzle.
//
// B is passed pre-transposed as (n, k), which keeps both shared loads
// contiguous and makes mma_ABt the right primitive.

// weight traffic does not. At M=32, K=3072, SPLIT_K=8 that is 10.5 MB of
// workspace against 31 MB of weights -- a 33% surcharge on a kernel that is
// purely bandwidth-bound. Measured at M=32, N=5120 (GB/s of weight traffic):

//            SPLIT_K:   1     2     4     8

//
// Monotone the other way from the M=8 table above, and SPLIT_K=1 wins outright.
// WARP_ROWS 1 vs 2 (REG_BLOCK_M 32 vs 16) is a wash once K is not split:
// 324/640 against 329/628, so the simpler one stays.
