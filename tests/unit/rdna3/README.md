# HipKittens unit tests — RDNA3 (gfx1100)

Unit tests for `include/rdna3`, run on an RX 7900 / W7900 class card.

### Requirements

- A gfx1100 GPU (wave32, 64KB LDS per workgroup, 256 arch VGPRs per wave)
- ROCm 6.4 or newer (developed against 7.2.4)
- A C++20 compiler

### Building and running

```bash
make -j32
./unit_tests
```

`GPU_TARGET`, `COMP_LEVEL`, `TEST_INTENSITY` and `TEST_DEFINES` are set in the
Makefile here and default to `RDNA3`, `profile`, `2` and `-DTEST_ALL`. Raise
`TEST_INTENSITY` to sweep larger tiles; it costs compile time roughly
quadratically. To narrow the run, replace `-DTEST_ALL` with a subsection such as
`-DTEST_WARP_MEMORY` or a single test like
`-DTEST_WARP_REGISTER_TILE_MMA`.

`./unit_tests printout` dumps failing tensors into `outputs/`, which you have to
create first.

### How this tree differs from `tests/unit/cdna4`

It is a port of that tree, so most files are recognisable, but three things had
to change and are worth knowing before you add a test.

**One tile shape.** The CDNA trees parameterize tests over `ducks::rt_shape` and
`ducks::st_shape` because MFMA comes in several geometries. gfx11 has exactly
one matrix instruction, `v_wmma_*_16x16x16_*`, so `include/rdna3` declares one
member of each namespace and every sweep here passes `rt_16x16` / `st_16x16`.
The shape parameters remain in the test signatures — the harness in
`../common/testing_commons` is shared with the CDNA trees and threads them
through positionally — but they are not a degree of freedom on this
architecture.

**`swap_layout` means something else.** On CDNA the layout-swap test really
sweeps *shapes*, often with both layouts the same. Here the only thing
`swap_layout` can change is the layout, and the destination layout is pinned to
`transpose<L>`, so `test_swap_layout` sweeps row→col and col→row instead.

**Replication shows up in the vector tests.** WMMA operands are mirrored across
the two wave halves and accumulators are not, so a `float` tile and a `bf16`
tile of the same logical shape keep their values in different lanes. Anything
that converts between the two — `copy` on `rt_base`, `copy` on an
`rv_layout::align` vector — moves data rather than just casting it, and the
tests for those paths are the ones most likely to catch a layout regression.
`include/rdna3/ops/warp/register/tile/conversions.cuh` opens with the picture
the whole port is derived from; read it first.

### Adding a test

Each `.cu` here wraps its scaffolding in an anonymous namespace. That is not
decoration: every file in the tree names its helpers the same way
(`test_generator`, `vec_load_store`, …), and as templates with external linkage
they collapse into one definition at link time, so whole sections silently run
some other file's tests. Keep the anonymous namespace, and keep
`<scope>::tests()` outside it.

The tree mirrors the layout of `include/rdna3`, which is how coverage gaps stay
visible.
