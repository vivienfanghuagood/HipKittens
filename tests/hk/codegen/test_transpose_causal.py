"""Transpose and causal masking: do they actually compile, and do the two
transposes really differ in cost?

The IR can only check the types. Whether `kittens::transpose` and
`kittens::transpose_sep` instantiate at all -- and what they cost -- is a
question for hipcc, which is this tier. The cost question matters because the
two have the same name in every kernel author's head and very different
register behaviour: `transpose` relabels, `transpose_sep` moves. The
handwritten attention epilogue transposes its output one fragment at a time
rather than whole-tile, and the note in that file says the whole-tile form was
worth 392 bytes/lane of scratch and 99 spilled VGPRs. So it is worth having a
test that would notice if the cheap one ever stopped being cheap.

    """The cost of `hk.transpose` is not in the transpose.

    Measured here: `relabel` wants 92 VGPRs and `move` wants 75, for the same
    16x64 -> 64x16 shape. The relabelling one is *dearer*, which is the
    opposite of what "moves no data" suggests, and the reason is the half of
    the signature that is easy to skim past: `transpose` mirrors the shape
    **and flips the layout**, so `relabel` ends up storing a `col` tile while
    `move` stores a `row` one. A col-layout store has the interleaved lane
    pattern that the compiler cannot merge -- the same effect that makes
    narrowing stores go bytewise on this chip -- and that is where the 17
    registers went.

    So the choice between them is not "which is cheaper" but "which layout
    does the consumer want". Feeding an mma that wants a col operand,
    `transpose` is free and `transpose_sep` would need a relabel afterwards.
    Feeding a global store, it is the other way round.

    The assertion is only that both stay spill-free at this size, because the
    exact counts are a compiler's business; the numbers above are a record of
    what was measured, not a contract.
