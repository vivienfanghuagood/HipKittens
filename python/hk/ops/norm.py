"""Row-wise normalizations: RMSNorm, LayerNorm, softmax.

The three share a skeleton -- reduce along a row, then rescale that row -- and
the skeleton is where all the difficulty is, so it is written once here and the
three kernels differ only in which reduction and which rescale.

Four things about that skeleton are worth reading before the code.

**The tensor does not have to tile.** include/rdna3 bounds-checks nothing, so a
partial block cannot simply be read: past the end of a torch allocation is a
fault, not zeros. The library's own answer (attn.cpp:735) is to back the
*address* up until the tile is wholly in bounds. That is exact for an
elementwise kernel -- the overlapping elements are simply computed twice with
the same answer -- but a reduction *along the axis you backed up* would count
those elements twice and give a wrong mean. So the overlap is masked with the
reduction's identity before it is folded in:

    lo  = s_min(cb * COLS, cols - COLS)   # backed-up start of block cb
    pad = cb * COLS - lo                  # 0 except in the last block
    t   = left_fill(load(x, (row, lo)), pad, identity)

Only for a reduction that is not idempotent, though. The overlap is real
elements of the same row, so a max or a min cannot be moved by seeing one of
them a second time; softmax's max pass and quantize's absmax pass skip the mask
entirely, and only the sums pay for it. The mask is also the reason `pad` is a
thunk: two of the three passes never ask for it.

Along rows there is nothing to mask: each row's normalization is independent of
every other, so recomputing a row in the backed-up last block writes the same
bytes. `lo_row` is a plain back-up.

Because the tile has to fit, this needs `rows >= ROWS` and `cols >= COLS`. A
hidden dimension smaller than 64 is not a case worth a second code path; the
wrapper says so rather than reading past the tensor.

**The accumulator is fp32 even when the tensor is bf16.** Not for the usual
accuracy reason alone: an rv's lane layout is derived from its element type, so
a bf16 tile and an fp32 vector do not agree about which lane holds which row,
and there is no such thing as a mixed-precision reduction here. The tensor is
loaded straight into an fp32 tile instead -- `kittens::load` runs the elements
through `base_types::convertor` on the way in -- and everything downstream is
fp32 until the store converts back.

That load is not free, and for a long time it was much less free than this
paragraph used to claim. An fp32 tile's lanes own every *other* column of a
16-element run, so a widening load issued one narrow access per element: 32
`global_load_u16` per 16x64 tile where two `global_load_b128` would do. The
answer is the same one the narrowing store already used in the other
direction -- read the whole run and pick, rather than ask the memory system
for a strided gather -- and it lives in `load`'s `widening` branch. It is also
why MAX_TPW's register figures moved: the narrow loads were live values.

**One warp per row block is not enough warps.** A 4096-row tensor at 16 rows
per block is 256 workgroups; this GPU has 192 SIMDs, so a one-warp workgroup
leaves 1.3 waves per SIMD and nothing to hide a load behind. The row is split
across WARPS warps of one workgroup instead and the partial reductions are
combined through LDS (lang.collective.cross_warp). That is parallelism bought
without an extra pass, and it is most of the difference between this and
torch.compile's numbers.

**The other half is the pass count.** Written the obvious way this is three
passes over memory for softmax and two for the others, because the values are
re-read rather than kept. torch inductor's generated kernel is *persistent*: it
holds the row in registers and reads it once. Per achieved byte the two are the
same speed, so the extra pass is the entire gap.

So this holds the row too, when it fits. `TPW` is how many 16x64 fp32 tiles
each warp keeps live; at WARPS=16 and TPW=4 that is a 4096-wide row held across
a 512-thread workgroup at 128 VGPRs a lane, and the kernel reads global memory
exactly once. When it does not fit, `TPW=0` selects the streaming variant and
the same code re-reads instead -- `visit()` below is deliberately the only
place that knows which.

A 16384-wide row does not fit either way: 16 rows of it is a megabyte. But *one*
row of it does, and `FOLD` is how a 16-row tile addresses a one-row problem --
the wrapper reshapes (R, C) to (R*16, C/16) so a tile's 16 rows are 16 chunks
of a single row, and `fold_rows` combines them at the end. See
lang.collective.fold_rows.

`plan` picks between the three, and it needs to know *which* of the three ops
is asking. rms and layer want the row held unfolded wherever that is legal;
softmax wants it folded at the same width, by half again. The reason is in
`_FOLD_FIRST_KINDS`, with the measurement.

    the occupancy is worth more than the halved workgroup count. The old rule
    could not express "five warps" and so could not reach either.

    That quantize row is the whole reason this changed -- it was the one shape
    in the Phase 2 bench where hk lost to torch.compile.

    Five warps and not six, even though six is faster in the table: six covers
    five blocks with a sixth warp that has nothing of its own and is clamped
    onto the last block, and "round the warp count *up* past the work" is a
    rule with one supporting measurement (rms, 2.8%, with quantize and softmax
    calling it noise) and no mechanism. Five covers the blocks exactly. The
    price is that rms at this one width gives up 1% against the old w4 tpw2,
    which is what the other two ops gain eleven and four and a half percent to
    pay for.

    The cost is kernels: WARPS is a constexpr, so admitting every count from 1
    to 16 takes the shipped table from 45 norm kernels to 144. They are
    compiled lazily and cached on content hash, so a process still pays only
    for the widths it sees.

      streaming           TPW=0, FOLD=1. Neither fits; re-read the row.

    `kind` is the one of "rms" / "layer" / "softmax" being planned, and it is
    here because the three do not want the same answer -- see
    _FOLD_FIRST_KINDS for the measurement that says so.

    **This function used to ask a fourth question and no longer does.** It
    took the bytes that had to stay live for the re-read to hit, and when they
    fit in the 96 MB Infinity Cache it capped TPW and refused to fold, on the
    argument that paying registers to avoid a second read is a straight loss
    when the second read is a cache hit at better than a terabyte a second.
    The argument is still sound and the conclusion was still wrong, for the
    same reason quant.plan's copy of it was: it priced the hold at what the
    hold used to cost. With the widening load the held variants win inside the
    cache as well, by more than they win outside it (norm_plan.py, every case
    resident; `plan` here is what the cache branch chose):

        rms   4096x4096   plan w16 tpw0 f1 0.088   w16 tpw4 f1 0.063

    Twenty-four to twenty-nine percent. So the regime question is gone, and
    with it the `working_set` argument and _CACHE_MAX_TPW. What remains true
    of the old branch is only its negative half: the *flat* rule it replaced
    (TPW=0, FOLD=1 everywhere, resident or not) was wrong by forty percent at
    1024 columns, and nothing below would pick it.

    Powers of two only for WARPS, so that the number of distinct kernels a
    process compiles stays small -- every (kind, dtype, WARPS, TPW, FOLD) is a
    separate hipcc invocation the first time it is seen.

    **What this still gets wrong**, from the sweep that fixed the rest of it
    (norm_plan.py, 16 cases; the rule names the winner or ties it in 12):

        rms 32768x2048   plan w16 tpw2 f1  0.358   w2 tpw0 f16  0.335   -6%
        rms 65536x1024   plan w16 tpw1 f1  0.367   w1 tpw0 f16  0.356   -3%
        softmax 8192x5120 plan w4 tpw2 f16 0.289   w2 tpw3 f16  0.275   -5%

    The first two are the same shape of miss: at a narrow width a *folded
    streaming* workgroup wins, and this function never emits one -- FOLD is
    only ever reached with a TPW that holds. The obvious patch is a fourth
    branch, and it is not taken, because 1024 columns disagrees with itself:
    at 16384 rows the plan's w16 tpw1 f1 is the outright winner (0.058 against
    0.064 for w1 tpw0 f16), and at 65536 rows it loses. Same width, opposite
    answers, so the width cannot decide it -- and what distinguishes the two
    is total size, which is the regime question this function just finished
    deleting on four cases' worth of evidence. Three percent is not enough to
    reinstate it on two.

    The third is _split's doing: 5 blocks over powers-of-two warps is 4x2,
    and the winner is 2x3. Admitting non-powers-of-two for WARPS would fix it
