"""Fused pointwise kernels: SwiGLU's activation half, and RoPE.

Neither has a reduction, which makes the out-of-bounds story the easy one: an
elementwise result does not depend on what else is in the tile, so backing the
last block up recomputes a few elements to the same answer and no masking is
needed anywhere. It also means nothing here needs `left_fill`, which is why
`silu_mul` takes any width at all and the norm kernels' `pad` thunk has no
counterpart in this file.

**The knob that mattered was not the one this file was built around.** The
obvious worry for a pointwise kernel is that one 16x64 tile per workgroup is not
enough work per wave -- at 8192x11008 that is 88064 workgroups of 32 threads
each doing two loads and a store, and the loads of one wave cannot overlap the
loads of the next because there is no next. So `silu_mul` took the same two
knobs the norm kernels do: WARPS warps per workgroup, each covering TILES column
blocks. Swept, all fifteen settings landed within 5% and the smallest won; with
tens of thousands of workgroups resident there was never a shortage of waves.
`plan` returns (1, 1) and says so.

What the same numbers did show is that the identical kernel ran at 716 GB/s
over an 8192x4096 tensor and 675 GB/s over an 8192x11008 one, doing the same
number of tiles in the same number of workgroups. The difference is the stride
a tile's 16 rows step by. And an elementwise kernel does not owe the caller its
row structure -- see `canonical`, which is where the speed actually came from.

RoPE is here rather than in a file of its own because the interesting part is
the same trick: the rotation pairs column j with column j + D/2, and there is
no cross-lane shuffle in the warp register API that would let one tile see
both. So the kernel loads *two* tiles from two column offsets -- which costs
nothing, since they are separate global reads either way -- and writes two. The
consequence is a real constraint, stated in the wrapper: D/2 must be a multiple
of the tile width.

    GPU behind it to hide Python in. The arguments are two ints and the answer
    is a pure function of them.

    silu_mul is elementwise, so the row structure is not part of the problem:
    a contiguous tensor may be viewed at any width dividing its element count
    and the kernel writes the same bytes to the same places. That makes the
    width a free parameter, and it is not a neutral one. The same kernel doing

    bytes against 22016.

    divides nothing in WIDTHS -- an odd hidden size -- keeps its own shape,
