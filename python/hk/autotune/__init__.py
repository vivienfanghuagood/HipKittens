"""Schedule search, with the resource gate in front of the GPU.

This is what replaces `kernels/rdna3/*/sweep.sh`. That script edits a `#define`,
runs `make clean`, recompiles, launches the benchmark, greps the number, and
repeats -- one candidate at a time, each in its own process, every one of them
reaching the GPU whether or not it had any business being there.

Three things are wrong with that, and this module is shaped by all three.

**Most candidates can be rejected without a GPU.** A schedule that spills is not
a slow schedule, it is a wrong one (include/rdna3 places `s_waitcnt` by hand and
scratch traffic reorders against it), and `Kernel.build()` already refuses to
return a `.so` for it. A schedule that drops an occupancy wave is visible in the
same compile. So stage 1 *compiles* the whole space and keeps only what passes
the gate; nothing that spills ever costs a GPU run, and on the GEMM space that
is most of the space.

**The compiles are independent.** hipcc is 4-40 s per kernel and a space is
dozens of them. Stage 1 hands the builds to `runtime.warm.warm_cache`, which
traces serially (the IR builder is a module-global stack) and compiles
`workers` at a time. Same code path as cache warming, because it is the same
problem.

**Cross-process A/B on this chip is invalid.** The W7900D's clock and power
state differs enough between process launches to manufacture a 13-16% gap out
of nothing, so a sweep that launches one process per candidate measures the
launch order as much as the schedule. Stage 2 times every survivor in *one*
process, in interleaved rounds whose order reverses, and keeps each candidate's
minimum. Drift that is monotone in wall-clock then hits both ends of the table
and falls out of the ranking.

The output is a record on disk: a schedule, the measurement that chose it, and
the toolchain fingerprint it was chosen under. Production reads the record and
compiles exactly one kernel. `python3 -m hk.autotune --aot` prebuilds every
recorded schedule into the content-addressed cache, which is what takes the JIT
off the serving path -- a `pip install`ed wheel plus a warmed cache launches
with a dict lookup in front of it.

    python3 -m hk.autotune --list              # what is tuned, and to what
    python3 -m hk.autotune --tune gemm_bf16    # run the search (needs a GPU)
    python3 -m hk.autotune --aot               # prebuild every recorded schedule

    The filter is the whole point. A tuning run always produces a winner --
    `min` over a column of noisy numbers is never a tie -- so shipping every
    winner means shipping measurement noise as a finding, and a user on a
    quieter machine then gets a tiling chosen by our fan curve. A record is
    carried only if it beat the *default* by `min_gain`, which is the reason
    `tune()` records `default_ms` beside `ms`.

    Two kinds of record are refused outright rather than shipped with a
    caveat, because a wheel travels further than a cache does:

    * no `default_ms` -- there is no answer to "faster than what?", so there
      is nothing to apply the threshold to;
    * no `arch` -- `_schedule_for` only rejects a foreign record when the
      record says which arch it came from, so an untagged record measured on
      gfx1100 would be applied on gfx1201 by a wheel that reached one.

    Both stay in the user's own records and keep working on this machine.
    Shipping them is what is refused; re-running `--tune` fixes both.
