"""The async-LDS pass: what it derives, and what it refuses.

Every failure in here is one that the C++ compiler accepts, that
`hip_resources.py` passes with ScratchSize 0, and that produces a wrong answer
only sometimes. That is the whole reason the pass exists, so the error paths
are worth more tests than the happy one -- a pass that silently stopped
checking would look exactly like a pass that had nothing to complain about.

The shape of the derivation: LDS retires in issue order, so retiring tile T
means waiting until only the reads issued *after* T are outstanding. `lgkmcnt`
counts individual ds_read instructions, which for a vectorised pair is two per
16x16 base tile -- see ops.lds_loads.
