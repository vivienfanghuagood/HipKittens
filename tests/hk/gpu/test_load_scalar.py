"""`hk.load_scalar`: indexing by a value fetched from memory.

This is the primitive a paged kernel needs and the one the IR did not have.
`block_idx` and arithmetic on it can express "block number 7"; a page table
can only be expressed by reading an integer out of a tensor and using it as an
address. The tests here are a gather -- `out[i] = x[table[i]]` -- because that
is the smallest thing that cannot be written without it.
