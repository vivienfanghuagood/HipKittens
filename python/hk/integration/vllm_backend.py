"""A vLLM attention backend that runs on the generated kernels.

This is the part an SDPA drop-in cannot reach. vLLM V1 keeps KV in a paged
cache and dispatches through `AttentionImpl.forward(..., kv_cache,
attn_metadata)`; there is no dense tensor on that path, so the only way into a
decoder is to *be* a backend. Registered as `HK_ATTN` through
`vllm.v1.attention.backends.registry.register_backend`, which is vLLM's own
hook for third-party backends.

    HK_PATCH_VLLM=1 vllm serve <model> --attention-backend HK_ATTN \\
        --no-enable-prefix-caching --enable-chunked-prefill=False

**The two flags are a real restriction, not boilerplate.** This backend
declares its own KV cache layout -- `(2, num_blocks, num_kv_heads, block_size,
head_size)` -- because `gl` derives strides from dims and vLLM's default
`(2, num_blocks, block_size, num_kv_heads, head_size)` cannot yield a
contiguous `(block_size, head_dim)` tile for one head. Having its own layout
means it cannot hand a prefill off to vLLM's Triton kernel, so prefill is
served by the *dense* kernel (`hk.ops.attn`) over the new tokens -- which is
only the whole answer when a prefill request's KV is exactly the tokens in
front of it. Prefix caching and chunked prefill both break that, so both are
refused rather than silently computing attention over part of the context.

What is missing, stated plainly: a paged prefill kernel. With one, both flags
go away. See `python/README.md`.

#:

_SLOT_NAME = "TRITON_ATTN"

#: The enum member to register under.
#:
#: vLLM's `AttentionBackendEnum` is closed -- `register_backend` records an
#: override for an existing member rather than adding one -- and it does
#: reserve `CUSTOM` for third parties. But `RocmPlatform.get_attn_backend_cls`
#: has an allowlist that `CUSTOM` is not on, so on ROCm selecting it fails
#: with "Attention backend CUSTOM is not supported on ROCm" before any of this
#: code runs. What does work is overriding a member the platform already
#: accepts: `get_path()` consults the override table, so a backend registered
#: under `TRITON_ATTN` is what `--attention-backend TRITON_ATTN` resolves to.
#:
#: That is a loaded gun -- `TRITON_ATTN` is also what ROCm picks by default --
#: so registration is its own opt-in (`HK_VLLM_BACKEND=1`) rather than
#: something `HK_PATCH_VLLM=1` does on the way past. Replacing the decoder
#: attention of a serving engine should take saying so.
