# HipKittens on RDNA3 / RDNA4

A port of HipKittens to AMD's consumer / workstation architectures — gfx11
(RDNA3: RX 7900, W7900) and gfx12 (RDNA4: RX 9070, W9000-class). Upstream
supports CDNA3/4/5 only.

This is a fork. Upstream is [HazyResearch/HipKittens](https://github.com/HazyResearch/HipKittens);
the work here lives on the `rdna` branch, seven commits on top of `de0cddbd`.

| | RDNA3 (gfx1100) | RDNA4 (gfx1201) |
|---|---|---|
| core library | `include/rdna3`, 68 files | `include/rdna4`, 68 files |
| unit tests | **1659 passed, 0 failed** on a W7900D | compiles; **never executed** |
| bf16 GEMM | **77.2 TFLOPs** peak, 77% of the measured WMMA ceiling. 107-119% of the best AMD library *in HipKittens' own layout*; 85-93% of that library when it is free to pick its own | compiles; never executed |
| fp8 | not available in hardware | implemented, all four opcodes, untested |

**Read the second column as "written, not verified."** No gfx12 part was
available. Every gfx12 claim about *where a value physically lives* is inferred
from builtin signatures, not measured. See
[`tests/unit/rdna4/README.md`](tests/unit/rdna4/README.md) for exactly which
claims are which, and run `./unit_tests` there first if you have the hardware.

## Why this is a separate tree and not a `#ifdef`

RDNA's matrix unit is WMMA, not MFMA, and the fragment layout is different
enough that sharing code would have meant an `#ifdef` in every load, store and
conversion. The repo already splits by architecture (`include/cdna3`,
`cdna4`, `cdna5`), so this follows that.

Three hardware facts drove essentially every design decision, all three
established by probe rather than by documentation:

**1. gfx11 WMMA operands are mirrored across the wave halves.** On gfx1100
wave32, a `v_wmma_f32_16x16x16_bf16` operand is `v16bf16` — 8 VGPRs — and lanes
`l` and `l+16` must hold *identical* data. A lane holds the entire K=16 vector.
Compare CDNA3's MFMA, where a lane holds 4 halves, K is split across lane
groups, and there is no redundancy at all.

The consequence is counterintuitive and it is the single most important thing
about this port: **a bf16 operand tile costs the same registers as an fp32
accumulator tile.** On RDNA3 the operand registers bound the tile shape, which
is the reverse of CDNA. It is why the GEMM cannot grow past a 128×128 block, and
why software-pipelining the operand loads measures *slower*.

(This also cost a false start. The first layout probe put a one-hot value in a
single lane without mirroring it, violating the hardware constraint, and read
back undefined behaviour that looked like a coherent — and wrong — layout.)

**2. gfx12 splits K between the halves instead.** Operands are `v8bf16`, 4
VGPRs, no redundancy: lane `l` holds `k = 8·(l/16) … +7` of row `l%16`. Half the
operand registers for the same tile. That is the point of RDNA4 for this
library. It also makes accumulator↔operand conversion *more* expensive, not
less — on gfx11 one direction was a free discard because the operand halves
already held everything; on gfx12 neither half does, so both directions cross
the halves at 8 `permlanex16` each.

**3. There is no global→LDS DMA on either.** `vmem-to-lds-load-insts` is absent
on gfx11 and gfx12 alike. HipKittens' third pillar — "asynchronous loads/stores
using direct buffer loads to shared memory" — has no hardware to stand on here.
Every prefetched byte passes through VGPRs and into the wave's instruction
stream. This is why `include/rdna3` is derived from `cdna3` rather than `cdna4`:
cdna3's `global_to_shared.cuh` already staged through `float4` buffers, which is
the only path RDNA has. It also caps how much of the paper's ping-pong schedule
is reachable, and the GEMM numbers should be read with that in mind.

## Coverage

**Library** (`include/rdna3`, `include/rdna4` — 68 files each, the same shape as
`include/cdna3`):

- Types: `rt_base` / `rt` / `st` / `st_subtile` / `sv` / `rv` / `gl`, both
  layouts, all three `rv_layout`s, `shared_allocator`, `group<N>`.
- Ops: warp and group, register and shared and global, tile and vector — maps,
  reductions, conversions, `mma_{AB,ABt,AtB,AtBt}`, and every
  `{global,shared}_to_{shared,register}` transfer.
- gfx11 WMMA (`f16`, `bf16`), gfx12 WMMA (`f16`, `bf16`, and all four fp8
  opcodes: `fp8_fp8`, `fp8_bf8`, `bf8_fp8`, `bf8_bf8`).

**Tests** (`tests/unit/rdna3`, `tests/unit/rdna4` — 64 files each, ported from
`tests/unit/cdna4`). RDNA3 at `TEST_INTENSITY=2`, on a W7900D:

```
1659 tests passed
0 tests failed
509 tests skipped (invalid template parameters)
```

The two test trees are the *same sources* — `diff -r` returns only the Makefile
and the README. That is deliberate and worth preserving: it tells a reader that
if gfx12 fails, the bug is in `include/rdna4`, not in the tests.

**Kernels**: `kernels/rdna3/gemm/bf16fp32` (measured, see its README) and
`kernels/rdna4/gemm/bf16fp32` (same source, gfx1201 target, untuned).

### Not covered

- **Attention.** The library primitive it needs most — accumulator→operand
  layout conversion via `permlanex16` — is implemented and tested on RDNA3, so
  the road is open, but no attention kernel is written.
- **fp8 as anything but a WMMA operand.** No maps, reductions or vector ops on
  fp8 register tiles. `constants<fp8e4m3>` deliberately has no infinity, so a
  reduction over one is a compile error rather than a silently wrong answer.
- **Split-K**, which is what the small-shape GEMM numbers are missing.
- **A 64×64 warp tile in the GEMM.** The LDS→register stage is now pipelined
  (at no register cost — see below), but the wider warp tile rocBLAS uses still
  does not fit in 256 VGPRs on gfx1100. That is the last 10%.
- **Multi-GPU / distributed**, untouched.
- **RDNA4 on hardware**, at all.

## Performance

W7900D (gfx1100, 96 CU). bf16 GEMM, fp32 accumulate. HipKittens implements one
layout — A (m,k), B (n,k), C = A·Bᵀ, both operands K-contiguous, torch's "NT" —
so the vendor gets two columns: its best of {NN, NT, TN, TT}, and the same
library restricted to that one layout.

| shape (M×N×K) | hipBLASLt best | rocBLAS best | vendor NT | HK | HK / best | HK / NT | HK / ceiling |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4096³ | 69.7 | **82.9** | 69.7 | 74.4 | 90% | **107%** | 74% |
| 8192×8192×4096 | 64.9 | **88.8** | 64.9 | 77.2 | 87% | **119%** | 77% |
| 4096×8192×2048 | 71.3 | **88.4** | 70.0 | 75.4 | 85% | **108%** | 75% |
| 8192×4096×2048 | 69.9 | **88.6** | 69.9 | 75.3 | 85% | **108%** | 75% |
| 2048×4096×4096 | 67.8 | **84.6** | 67.8 | 73.7 | 87% | **109%** | 73% |
| 2048×2048×4096 | 63.8 | **75.8** | 57.7 | 67.4 | 89% | **117%** | 67% |
| 2048³ | 60.2 | **69.8** | 55.1 | 64.5 | 92% | **117%** | 64% |

**Three corrections to numbers this file previously carried.** The first two
made the kernel look better than it is; the third made it look worse.

*The baseline was the wrong library.* torch on ROCm defaults to hipBLASLt, and
on gfx1100 hipBLASLt is the slower of the two by up to 33% — rocBLAS wins every
shape here. Benchmarking against torch's default is benchmarking against the
library AMD has not tuned for this architecture. The honest statement is "beats
hipBLASLt everywhere", not the "wins 2 of 4" that the hipBLASLt-only table
showed.

*The denominator was unreachable.* 122.6 TFLOPs is 96 CU × 512 FLOP/clk ×
2.495 GHz boost. This card does not run a GEMM at 2.495 GHz: `rocm-smi` sampled
under load shows 2.0-2.1 GHz against a 241 W limit. Back-to-back WMMA with no
memory at all measures **100.5 TFLOPs**
([`tools/rdna-probes/wmma_peak.hip`](tools/rdna-probes/wmma_peak.hip)) — 94% of
the architectural issue rate, at 2.18 GHz and only 101 W. The reachable peak is
~104, so percentages against 122.6 understate by about 18%.

*The comparison was against a different problem.* rocBLAS's 88-90 TFLOPs
headline is reached in NN, TN or TT. Restricted to the layout this kernel
implements — NT, both operands K-contiguous — it reaches 55-70, and HipKittens
is **107-119% of the best AMD library** there, on every shape. Neither column is
the "real" one; they answer different questions, and both are now printed.

### What the vendor's layout spread actually is

rocBLAS at 8192×8192×4096 measures NN 85.7, **NT 56.0**, TN 90.2, TT 89.9.
Three of four are within 5%; the outlier is the one with *both* operands
K-contiguous, which is the one HipKittens implements. Disassembling the two
kernels rocprofv3 dispatches (unbundle the `CCOB` `.co` files with
`clang-offload-bundler --unbundle`) shows NT and TT are the *same* Tensile
kernel — `MT128x128x16`, 4 waves of 64×64, `PGR1 PLR1`, 256 VGPRs — and that the
slow one has the cleaner inner loop: 16 × `ds_load_b128` against TT's 8 ×
`ds_load_b128` + 64 × `ds_load_u16` for the same lane-bytes. The difference is
not in there.

It is global-load granularity. A K-contiguous operand tiled at K=16 is 128 rows
of 32 bytes — a quarter of a cache line each, on both operands. This kernel can
measure the penalty because `K_STEP` is a `-D`; same tiling, same layout, only
the K-tile depth moving (128×128, 8 warps, 8192×8192×4096, against
`ABLATE_GLOBAL`):

| `K_STEP` | bytes per tile row | full | no global stage | global costs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 16 | 32 | 59 | 81 | **22** |
| 32 | 64 | 77 | 87 | **10** |
| 64 | **128** | 78 | 83 | **5** |

and `GPREFETCH` 1→8 does not move it, so it is granularity, not latency. **The
vendor's 56 in the NT column is what that layout costs at a 16-deep K-tile, and
Tensile's gfx1100 tuning has no deeper NT entry to pick. This kernel runs a
64-deep one and pays 5 instead of 22 — that, and not a better inner loop, is the
whole of the >100% in the HK/NT column.**

The remaining gap to the vendor's *best* layout is a different thing, and it is
now accounted for exactly rather than estimated: **LDS lane-bytes**.

A gfx11 WMMA operand is mirrored across the wave halves, so lanes `l` and `l^16`
issue `ds_read_b128` against the same address. LDS charges for that duplicate in
full — `lds_peak.hip` mode `ST` reproduces the kernel's exact addressing and
measures 64.8 lane-bytes/clk/CU, i.e. 129.6 per WGP, which *is* the hardware's
128 B/clk/WGP. So per WGP per K-tile at 128×128×64: reads are 8 waves × 48
`ds_read_b128` × 512 lane-B ÷ 128 B/clk = **1536 cycles against 2048 cycles of
WMMA in the same window (75%)**, and writes add 256 more (**87% total**). The
kernel sits at 77% of the WMMA ceiling; there is no room under 87% for it to sit
much higher.

It is worth saying what it is *not*, because both alternatives look plausible
from the disassembly and both were checked. It is not instruction count: rocBLAS
issues 5.3× more LDS instructions (128 × `ds_load_u16` against 24 ×
`ds_read_b128` per 16 WMMAs) and still wins. And it is not bank conflicts:
[`tools/rdna-probes/lds_peak.hip`](tools/rdna-probes/lds_peak.hip) measures this
tree's access pattern at 64.8 bytes/clk/CU, tied with a hand-built conflict-free
reference and 4.1× the same read with the swizzle removed. The swizzle constant
is right.

Every escape from that was measured and none works. **Occupancy** is not the
lever — 2, 4 and 8 waves/SIMD measure 79, 78 and 63, because latency hiding here
comes from the software pipeline and not from resident waves. **Deeper global
prefetch** is flat at K_STEP ≥ 32. **Clocks** are not a hidden denominator: 20 s
of steady state holds 2171 MHz, the same clock the WMMA probe ran at. And
**wave64**, the one structural way to kill the mirror, is worse: gfx1100's
`__builtin_amdgcn_wmma_f32_16x16x16_bf16_w64` takes A and B as `v16i16` — 8
VGPRs, the full K=16 per lane, identical to wave32 — so 64 lanes hold 1024 halves
for a 256-element matrix, **4× replication against wave32's 2×**.

Half of the gap that *was* closeable has been closed, and how is the part worth
carrying forward. rocBLAS pays for its wider tile with a software pipeline (`PLR1`) that
costs registers; the textbook version of that here — double-buffering the
operand tiles — costs 48 VGPRs, drops occupancy from 9 waves/SIMD to 7, and
measures *slower*. The version that works costs nothing, because `lds_wait<N>()`
waits until at most N LDS ops are still outstanding and LDS retires in order.
Split the accumulator and the B operand into chunks along N, issue the whole
slice's reads at once, and step the waits down: each chunk's WMMAs then run on
top of the reads for the chunks after it. Then rotate — a B chunk's registers
are dead the moment its WMMAs have issued, so the next K-slice's reads for that
chunk go in flight right there. Register count is identical at every step (161
VGPRs before the split, after the split, after the rotation), and it is worth
65 → 70 TFLOPs at 4096³.

It also moved two other optima, which is the usual reason to redo a sweep after
a scheduling change rather than assume it composes. A deeper K-tile became worth
its staging registers (`K_STEP` 32 → 64, 70 → 73, despite occupancy 9 → 7),
because more K-slices means more rotation points. And the small-shape crossover
moved by 4×, from 256 workgroups to 64.

What is left is the tile itself: 64×64 needs 128 VGPRs of accumulator plus 64 of
operands, and the operands are already 2× larger than they would be on CDNA
because of the wave-half mirroring. There is no intermediate tile — accumulator
VGPRs are `M·N/32` regardless of shape, so square is strictly optimal among
powers of two, and 48-row tiles need `BLOCK_M=192`, which divides none of the
benchmark shapes. **That is the wall, and it is an architectural one.** The full
config sweep is in
[`kernels/rdna3/gemm/bf16fp32/README.md`](kernels/rdna3/gemm/bf16fp32/README.md).

Small shapes are a separate problem: grid quantization, not the inner loop.
`dispatch_micro` compiles two tilings and picks by workgroup count. Below about
64 workgroups even the small tiling falls off (33 TFLOPs at 512×512×4096);
split-K is still missing and is the next thing for that regime.

RDNA4 has not been run. What is known is a register count: the operand tiles
cost 24 VGPRs there against 48 on gfx1100, and the ported kernel sits at 128
VGPRs where 10 waves/SIMD holds to 144 — so there is headroom the gfx1100 shape
could not use, and double-buffering costs one occupancy step there instead of
two. fp8 will *not* help the math rate: gfx12's fp8 WMMA is 16×16×16, the same
shape as bf16, not CDNA's K=32. One WMMA is one WMMA.

## Notes for anyone continuing this

Things that cost time and are written down so they cost it only once:

- **`s_waitcnt` is split on gfx12** into `s_wait_dscnt` / `s_wait_loadcnt` /
  `s_wait_storecnt` / `s_wait_kmcnt`. The trap is that the combined legacy
  `s_waitcnt lgkmcnt(0)` still *assembles* for gfx1201 — LLVM just never emits
  it — so inline asm inherited from a CDNA tree looks fine and silently waits on
  the wrong thing.
- **Inline asm for LDS is mandatory, not stylistic.** A `shared_allocator` tile
  is a generic pointer, so `*(float4*)p` emits `flat_load_b128` rather than
  `ds_load_b128`. Right width, wrong pipe. Worth 7 TFLOPs in the GEMM.
- **The V# buffer descriptor word is `0x31004000`** for gfx11 *and* gfx12, not
  CDNA's `0x110000` — gfx10+ replaced `DATA_FORMAT`/`NUM_FORMAT` with `FORMAT`.
- **fp8 on gfx12 is OCP, on gfx942 it is fnuz**, and HIP gates them by target.
  The fnuz types are still declared on gfx12, so a typedef inherited from the
  CDNA tree compiles until the first thing instantiates it.
- **Benchmark against rocBLAS, not against torch's default.** torch on ROCm
  picks hipBLASLt, and on gfx1100 that is the library with the thinner Tensile
  tuning — rocBLAS is up to 33% faster on the same shape. Switch with
  `torch.backends.cuda.preferred_blas_library("cublas")`, and take best-of-four
  transposes while you are there: at 8192×8192×4096 rocBLAS measures NN 85.7,
  NT 56.0, TN 90.2, TT 89.9 — a 1.6× spread, all of it in the single outlier.
- **Do not use the data-sheet peak as a denominator.** Measure the ceiling with
  `tools/rdna-probes/wmma_peak.hip` and sample `rocm-smi -c -P` during the run.
  This card is clock- and power-limited well below boost under any real load.
- **The layout probe is the ground truth**, not the ISA doc:
  [`tools/rdna-probes/`](tools/rdna-probes/), and `wmma_layout.hip` in
  particular, which has a `PROBE_GFX12_W32` variant already written for whenever
  a gfx12 card turns up. Mirror the one-hot across `l` and `l^16` on gfx11 or
  you will measure undefined behaviour.

Per-area detail lives next to the code: `include/rdna3/ops/warp/register/tile/
conversions.cuh` opens with the layout derivation the whole port rests on, and
each of the four READMEs (`tests/unit/rdna{3,4}`, `kernels/rdna{3,4}/gemm/
bf16fp32`) says what is verified and what is not.
