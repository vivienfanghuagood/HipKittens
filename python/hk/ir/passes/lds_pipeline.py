"""Derive every `s_waitcnt lgkmcnt` count, and prove every async tile is bound.

This pass is the reason the IR exists.

`load_shared(wait=False)` issues its ds_reads through an inline-asm *output*
operand, so LLVM believes the destination is ready the instant the asm ends.
`s_waitcnt` is a separate volatile asm sharing no operands with it, and
`v_wmma` is a pure builtin with no memory effect. Nothing in the IR stops the
scheduler from hoisting a consuming WMMA above the wait, and it does --
nondeterministically, as soon as register pressure shifts. It is not a spill:
ScratchSize stays 0 while the answer changes from run to run. The fix is to
bind the tile's registers after the wait, which `kittens::lds_wait_for` does;
the problem is that a human writing it by hand forgets, and nothing tells them.

So three things are checked here, and they are errors, not warnings:

  * a tile whose reads are outstanding may not be read;
  * a tile whose reads have been retired by somebody else's wait may not be
    read either, because retiring is not binding; and
  * a barrier may not be reached with LDS ops in flight, because `s_barrier`
    orders execution and not memory.

And one thing is *computed*, so that it cannot be got wrong: the `N` in
`lgkmcnt(N)`. LDS returns in order, so retiring tile T means waiting until only
the reads issued after T are outstanding. The handwritten GEMM derives exactly
this number with a constexpr function and a paragraph explaining why
(`CHUNK_READS` in kernels/rdna3/gemm/bf16fp32/gemm.cpp); here it falls out of
walking the issue queue, and `lds_wait_for` has no `n` parameter to get wrong.

**Loops.** A prefetching loop issues reads for iteration k+1 and waits for
iteration k's at the top of the *next* iteration, so the queue is non-empty
across the back edge and the derived N depends on state from the previous
iteration. The pass therefore walks each loop body twice, the second time
starting from the state the first left, and requires the two to agree. A body
whose derived counts differ between the two passes has no steady state -- the
queue grows or shrinks each iteration -- and that is reported rather than
guessed at, because either answer would be wrong for some iteration.
