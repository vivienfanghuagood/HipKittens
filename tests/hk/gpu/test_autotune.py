"""Autotune end to end: compile a space, time it, record it, use the record.

The IR tier (`tests/hk/ir/test_autotune.py`) covers the search with the build
stage stubbed out, which is most of the logic. What it cannot cover is that the
thing the tuner hands to the benchmark is a kernel that launches, that the
record it writes is the one production reads back, and that a schedule rejected
by the resource gate was rejected by *hipcc* rather than by a mock. So this
file runs one small space for real.

Small on purpose: every candidate here is a compile, and a compile is tens of
seconds. The claim under test is that the path works, not that a particular
tiling wins.
