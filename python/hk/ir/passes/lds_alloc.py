"""Assign LDS offsets to shared tiles.

gfx11 has no global->LDS DMA, so there is no in-flight copy to track and
allocation is a straight bump allocator over the dynamic shared segment -- the
same thing kernels/rdna3 does by hand with a `shared_allocator`.

Tiles are laid out in declaration order and each is aligned to its own size when
that size is a power of two. That is not cosmetic: the double-buffer swap in the
attention kernel flips buffers by XOR-ing one bit into every LDS address rather
than re-deriving them, which requires the two buffers of a pair to differ in
exactly one bit. Allocating in declaration order with power-of-two alignment is
what makes that legal, and `lds_xor_ok` records whether it held.
