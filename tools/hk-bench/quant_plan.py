"""Which (WARPS, TPW) an int8 quantization deserves, measured instead of argued.

`quant.plan` inherited its rule from `norm.plan` without ever being swept, and
the two passes are not the same shape of problem. Quantization reads bf16 and
writes int8, so its write is half its read and the ratio the persistent variant
saves is different. Whatever norm measured does not transfer, so measure this.

FOLD is in the sweep now. It was not at first -- a folded workgroup owns one
row and so has one scale to write, which `store` cannot express -- and the
answer was `hk.store_scalar`. See quant.plan.

The cases below sit on both sides of the 96 MB Infinity Cache, because that
used to be a question `plan` branched on -- a pass whose working set fits in
cache was held not to want the register-held variant, since the second read it
avoids would have been a hit. The sweep refuted that, here and in norm.plan;
the cases stay so the refutation keeps being checkable.
