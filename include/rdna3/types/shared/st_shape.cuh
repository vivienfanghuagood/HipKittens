/**
 * @namespace st_shape
 *
 * @brief Names the base block a shared tile is tiled out of.
 *
 * A note on what this does and does not control here. On CDNA4 the shape is a
 * layout *selector*: `st<T, rows, cols, shape>` asks the shape for the address
 * of every element, so swapping `st_16x16` for `st_16x16_swizzled` genuinely
 * changes where the bytes land. rdna3's `st` descends from the cdna3 design,
 * where the XOR swizzle is chosen from the tile's own width inside
 * `st::idx()` -- see `st.cuh` -- and there is no shape parameter to pass.
 *
 * So the member below is a *description* of what rdna3's shared tiles already
 * do, not a knob. It exists because the shared unit test harness is written
 * against the CDNA API and names a shape in nearly every signature; giving
 * rdna3 the one shape its tiles actually use lets those tests be ported
 * without forking the harness. If the shared tile ever does become
 * shape-parameterized on this arch -- the swizzle retuning that Phase 7 calls
 * for is the obvious reason to do it -- this is where the alternatives go.
