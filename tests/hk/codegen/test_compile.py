"""Generate, compile, and read the resource remarks back.

Needs hipcc; does not need a GPU or torch, because nothing here launches. That
is the point of this tier: the thing most likely to break -- generated code that
compiles but spills, or compiles for the wrong arch -- is caught on a laptop.

Cold, each kernel costs a few seconds of hipcc. The content-hash cache makes
every rerun free, so keep the cache directory between runs.
