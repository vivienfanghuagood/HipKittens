# hk — HipKittens as a Python kernel IR

Write Radeon kernels in Python, get HipKittens C++, get a `.so`, call it from
torch. The point is not convenience: it is that three classes of *silently
wrong* kernel on RDNA3 stop being expressible.

```python
import hk
from hk import bf16

@hk.kernel(arch="gfx1100",
           grid=lambda p: (hk.cdiv(p.o.cols, 64), hk.cdiv(p.o.rows, 16), 1))
def add(a: hk.GL[bf16], b: hk.GL[bf16], o: hk.GL[bf16], *, ROWS=16, COLS=64):
    t   = hk.rt(bf16, ROWS, COLS)
    idx = hk.tile_coord(0, 0, hk.block_idx.y, hk.block_idx.x)
    hk.store(o, hk.load(a, idx, t) + hk.load(b, idx, t), idx)

add(a, b, out)          # traces, compiles (once), launches
```

Three entry points, in increasing order of what they need:

| call | needs | does |
|---|---|---|
| `k.trace()` | nothing | runs the body once, returns the IR |
| `k.source()` | nothing | the generated HipKittens C++ |
| `k.build()` | hipcc | compiles and **gates on the resource remarks** |
| `k(*tensors)` | a Radeon + torch | launches |

`build()` needing no GPU is deliberate: the failure most likely to bite —
generated code that compiles but spills — is caught on a laptop.

## Why this exists

`include/rdna3` is 9494 lines of verified C++ hitting 77.2 TFLOPs on GEMM and
64–65 on attention. Using it meant writing C++: `kernels/rdna3/attn/fwd/attn.cpp`
is 1237 lines plus 20 `#define` knobs, and retuning meant editing macros,
`make clean`, rebuild, remeasure. vLLM and SGLang could not touch it.

But the real argument is the three traps, each of which cost days:

1. **`s_waitcnt` carries no register dependence.** The compiler will hoist a
   WMMA above the wait that was supposed to guard it. Results are randomly
   wrong, `ScratchSize` is 0, and nothing is reported. The emitter binds the
   fragment with a volatile asm after every wait — you cannot forget to.
2. **A VGPR spill is silent corruption, not slowness**, because this library
   hand-places `s_waitcnt` and scratch traffic reorders against it.
   `hk.build()` parses `-Rpass-analysis=kernel-resource-usage` and *refuses to
   return* a spilling kernel.
3. **Only row-layout 16-bit operands reach `ds_read_b128`**; column layout
   degrades to 16 scalar `ds_read_u16`, eight times the instructions. The
   verifier rejects it while tracing, not at benchmark time.

Plus the arch facts that used to live in `RDNA.md`, kernel comments and
notebooks, now in `target/gfx1100.py` as data shared by the verifier, the LDS
allocator, the register model and the emitter — the VGPR granule is 24, so
occupancy 6 needs ≤240 registers, not ≤256.

An op that the library does not implement for the requested dtype is the same
kind of late failure, so it is caught the same way: `hk.gelu` on a bf16 tile
raises while tracing rather than producing `undefined hidden symbol` at the end
of a 30-second compile.

## Layout

```
hk/lang/        the DSL surface -- @kernel, tile types, ops
hk/ir/          Value/Op/KernelIR, the tracing builder, passes
hk/target/      gfx1100 / gfx1201 facts, as data
hk/codegen/     IR -> HipKittens C++ (cpp.py) and the module boundary (scaffold.py)
hk/runtime/     arch detection, hipcc + content-hash cache, the resource gate,
                and the torch.ops registration (torch_ext.py)
hk/autotune/    schedule search: build the space, keep what passes the gate, time
hk/tuned/       the schedules that search picked, as shipped data
hk/ops/         kernels written in the DSL, plus the SDPA drop-in (sdpa.py)
hk/integration/ patching a running vLLM or SGLang
```

The generated C++ is kept readable — named tile aliases, value names shared
with the IR dump, a provenance header — because it is the artifact you take to
the disassembler when something spills.

`codegen/scaffold.py` is separate from `codegen/cpp.py` so that the torch
registration path can reuse the identical kernel body instead of becoming a
second emitter that drifts.

## Caching

Key = hipcc version + a content hash of `include/rdna3` + the full flag list +
the generated source. A build lands in `~/.cache/hk/<key>/` via a rename, so a
killed compile never leaves an importable half-written `.so`. Failed builds are
kept as `failed-<key>/` with their source and log.

The thresholds (`max_vgprs`, `min_occupancy`) are *not* in the key — they are
re-applied on every cache hit, so a kernel with a strict occupancy requirement
is not let through by whoever happened to compile the same bytes first.

First compile of a small kernel is ~5 s; an attention kernel is 20–40 s.

`python3 -m hk.runtime.warm -j 32` fills the cache in parallel (19x on 24
kernels), and `python3 -m hk.autotune --aot` does the same for every schedule a
tuning record can reach. Those two are how the serving path ends up with no
hipcc in it.

## Tests

Three tiers, by what they need. The first two run anywhere:

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/hk/ir tests/hk/codegen -q   # no GPU, no torch
```

| tier | needs | what it catches |
|---|---|---|
| `tests/hk/ir/` | pure Python | tracing and emitted C++ |
| `tests/hk/codegen/` | hipcc | compiles; spill/occupancy gates fire |
| `tests/hk/gpu/` | Radeon + torch | numerics vs torch |

A tier that cannot run is skipped with a reason, never silently passed.

## Status

**Phases 1 and 2 are done.** End to end: Python → IR → C++ → hipcc → `.so` →
torch. 291 shipped kernels — elementwise (5 binary × 3 dtypes plus the unary ops
the library specialises), RMSNorm / LayerNorm / softmax, RoPE, SiLU-mul, and
per-row int8 quantize/dequantize. Every one builds with `scratch=0 spill=0`
(a hard gate, not a check) and matches torch elementwise on a W7900D, including
shapes that do not divide the tile.

Phase 2's gate was "do not require a win". It won anyway: against
`torch.compile` on a W7900D, 13 of 15 cases are faster and the other two
(`quantize 16384x4096` and `layernorm 16384x5120`) land within 1% behind --
which is inside the same noise band Phase 5 later had to make explicit, and so
is reported as a tie rather than as a win for either side.

```
case                        hk      compile    eager
rmsnorm   4096x4096      0.060 ms   0.093     0.418
rmsnorm  16384x5120      0.486      0.775     2.823
layernorm 4096x4096      0.061      0.081     0.063
softmax   8192x16384     0.707      0.874     0.738
silu_mul  8192x11008     0.761      0.763     1.218
rope     128x1024x128    0.076      0.107     0.583
quantize 16384x5120      0.367      0.369     6.118
```

Getting there was mostly *not* kernel work. A 4096x4096 quantize is 60 µs of
GPU; the Python wrapper around it was 13.9 µs. Three rounds — memoising the
launcher on the kwargs as passed, caching the plan on the `torch.dtype` object
rather than `str(dtype)`, and a pybind converter that interns the attribute
names and reads a tensor in five Python calls (`pyutils/hk_bind.cuh`) — took the
worst wrapper to 9.9 µs and `rmsnorm` from 11.3 to 6.6. See
`tools/hk-bench/host_overhead.py`, which measures host time, queue depth and
device time separately so the three cannot be confused for each other.

**Phase 3 is done: the generated GEMM matches the handwritten one.** The hard
gate was three numbers at once -- same `ScratchSize`, same occupancy, and
77.2 TFLOPs. On the pod's ROCm 7.2.4, `hk.ops.matmul` and
`kernels/rdna3/gemm/bf16fp32/gemm.cpp`'s `config<128,128,64,16,8,4,8,4>` compile
to *the same* 209 VGPRs, 0 scratch, 0 spill, 7 waves/SIMD, 64 KB LDS, and run
within noise of each other:

```
shape                 variant         ms    TFLOPs   vs C++
4096x4096x4096        hk (DSL)     1.831      75.0    1.00x
4096x4096x4096        C++          1.833      75.0    1.00x
4096x4096x4096        rocBLAS      1.975      69.6    0.93x

8192x8192x4096        hk (DSL)     7.055      77.9    1.00x
8192x8192x4096        C++          7.047      78.0    1.00x
8192x8192x4096        rocBLAS      7.661      71.8    0.92x
```

Same-process interleaved, bit-identity checked before timing
(`tools/hk-bench/gemm_ab.py`). Disassembled, the two kernels issue the identical
64 WMMAs, 96 `ds_read`s, 16 `ds_write`s and 24 global loads; the generated one
has 52 *fewer* scalar and vector ALU instructions.

It did not start there -- the first measurement was 2.4% and 3.0% behind, and
the whole of it was one instruction. `hk.ops.barrier` is documented as ordering
execution and not memory, but the emitter was lowering it to `__syncthreads()`,
which promises to order global memory too and on gfx11 pays for that with a
`buffer_gl0_inv`: a per-WGP vector L0 flush, once per K-tile, throwing away the
B-tile lines the other workgroup on the WGP was about to read. Emitting
`__builtin_amdgcn_s_barrier()` instead -- which is what the handwritten kernel
calls, and what the op always meant -- closed the entire gap. The LDS side is
not weakened by this: `lds_pipeline` proves it separately, either by finding a
wait that already retired the queue or by making the author write
`barrier(drain=True)`.

**Phase 4 is done: the generated attention kernel matches the handwritten one,
and beats it under causal.** The gate was 64-65 TFLOPs plus elementwise
agreement with `F.scaled_dot_product_attention` across every H3 shape, a
non-dividing N, B=2, GQA and causal. Same process, interleaved, both kernels
loaded at once (`hk/ops/_attn_ab.py`):

```
shape           dsl ms   dsl TF   c++ ms   c++ TF  dsl/c++
N=4096           7.880     61.0    7.895     60.9   1.002x
N=8192          30.528     63.0   30.527     63.0   1.000x
N=16384        120.334     64.0  120.300     64.0   1.000x
N=32768        475.309     64.8  475.132     64.8   1.000x
480p/5s       1100.228     64.9 1099.149     65.0   0.999x
causal 8192     16.628     57.9   16.754     57.4   1.008x
```

Against torch SDPA on the same chip that is 2.9-3.2x, and 4.0x causal. 31
numerical cases pass (`tests/hk/gpu/test_attn.py`). The generated kernel also
runs at **occupancy 6 against the handwritten kernel's 5** -- 224 VGPRs versus
247 -- which is the one place the IR is structurally ahead rather than level.

Three findings came out of getting there, and all three now live in the library
or the IR rather than in a kernel:

* **`warpid()` costs a divergent branch.** It is `threadIdx.x >> 5`, which the
  compiler keeps in a VGPR because it cannot see that a wave is 32 consecutive
  threads. Anything derived from it inherits the VGPR, so a comparison on it
  becomes `v_cmpx` with exec save and restore rather than one `s_cbranch`, and
  every value the branch needs is pinned in a vector register across it. The
  causal kernel spilled 90 VGPRs that way and none with
  `kittens::warpid_uniform()`.

* **An index inside a tile mask costs one register per element.** Written the
  obvious way -- ask `rt_base_coord` for (row, col) and evaluate the predicate
  -- a mask holds 8 loop-invariant registers, which LLVM hoists into the
  preheader and spills. Writing it as `dbase >= thr` with a scalar threshold is
  *worse*: LLVM reassociates straight back. The fix is to fold the index into
  the lane term so the per-element part is an integer literal after unrolling,
  which is one register for the whole tile. `detail::diag_fill` and
  `detail::axis_fill` in `conversions.cuh` now do this for all eight fills.

* **Branches in the hot region are a register-allocation lever, and the trade
  is asymmetric.** A mask that fires on one block in the whole loop (the
  backed-up last KV block) is worth a uniform branch: 224 VGPRs and no spill
  with it, 116 B/lane without. A mask that fires on nearly every block (causal)
  is worth no branch at all: 226 and none without it, 156 B/lane with it.

The last 2% was one thing the IR could not say. The handwritten kernel skips
the online-softmax rescale when the running max did not grow -- 64 `v_mul_f32`
per KV block at head_dim 128, against that block's 32 WMMAs -- and that needs a
predicate that reduces *out of* the register file and into control flow, which
no elementwise op can produce. `hk.s_any_ne` is that op, and it closed the gap
exactly. Causal then went ahead on longest-processing-time-first dispatch: the
work per workgroup is a ramp, so reversing the q index starts the long ones
while there is still short work to fill the slots they free.

**Phase 5 is done: `hk.autotune` replaces `sweep.sh`, and most of what it
measured turned out not to be worth acting on.** A `Tuner` is a kernel factory, a schedule
space and a record. Searching it is two stages, and the first one never touches
the GPU:

```
python3 -m hk.autotune --list
python3 -m hk.autotune --tune gemm_bf16 -j 32      # search
python3 -m hk.autotune --ship                      # promote what is real
python3 -m hk.autotune --aot  -j 32                # prebuild it all
```

Stage 1 builds every candidate through `runtime.warm` -- 32 hipcc invocations
at a time -- and three kinds of candidate die there for free: the factory's own
arithmetic refuses a tiling that does not divide, the verifier refuses an
illegal layout, and the resource gate refuses anything that spills. Of
attention's 32 schedules, 26 never reach the GPU. Stage 2 times what is left in
*one process*, interleaved, reversing the order on odd rounds and scoring each
candidate by its minimum, because cross-process A/B on this chip manufactures
13-16% differences out of nothing.

The production path never searches. `Tuner.kernel(key)` is a dict probe and a
memoised factory call, so a record costs nothing per launch; a missing, stale
or foreign record costs performance and never correctness.

`min` over a column of noisy numbers always names a winner, so a tuner that
ships its winner unconditionally ships noise as a finding. `tune()` therefore
also records `default_ms`, and a record changes nothing unless it beat the
default by `MIN_GAIN` (1%). The bar is applied at `--ship` *and* on the lookup
path, so a record measured here is held to the same standard as one that
arrived in a wheel; `HK_AUTOTUNE_MIN_GAIN` moves it and `HK_AUTOTUNE=0` ignores
records entirely.

Out of 16 keys across five tuners, four clear it:

```
tuner                  key                 winner                  gain
gemm_bf16              4096x4096x4096      k_step32 wgm16 pos1    +1.2%
attn_fwd_d128          n16384              qk1 pv2                +1.1%
attn_fwd_d128          n65536              qk1 pv2                +1.1%
attn_fwd_d128_causal   n4096               qk1 pv1                +2.8%
```

The other twelve stay on the default, including every `gemm_bf16` shape but
one and all six `attn_fwd_d64` keys. That is the result and not a gap: a space
whose winners are inside the noise is a space whose default was already right.

The bar had to be checked against itself before any of this was believable.
The first attention sweep reported gains of 0.10-0.21% with four *different*
winners across three lengths -- a coin. A second sweep on the same machine
reported 0.26% to 2.8%. Two runs of one tuner disagreeing by 10x is not a
result, so the three keys above were re-measured three times each at
`--rounds 5`:

```
key                        repeat 1        repeat 2        repeat 3
d128 n16384          qk1 pv2 +1.04%  qk1 pv2 +0.99%  qk1 pv2 +1.00%
d128 n65536          qk1 pv2 +1.12%  qk1 pv2 +1.12%  qk1 pv2 +1.09%
d128_causal n4096    qk2 pv1 +1.81%  qk1 pv4 +2.13%  qk1 pv2 +1.29%
```

The first two reproduce exactly -- same schedule, same gain to within 0.05 --
so `qk1 pv2` is a real if small win at head_dim 128, and the original sweep's
0.1% was the measurement that was wrong. The third says something different
and more useful: at `n4096` causal the gain is reproducible but the *winner* is
not, because the default (`qk2 pv2`) is specifically the slow one there and all
three alternatives beat it by about the same amount. The shipped record names
one of them, and this paragraph is what stops the next reader from concluding
that `qk1 pv1` is special.

`--aot` prebuilds every schedule production can reach -- the recorded ones *and*
the default, since the default is what an unrecorded key gets -- into the
content-addressed cache, which is what takes hipcc's 20-40 s off the first
request. `pip install -e .` works from the repo root; `hk/tuned/*.json` and
`hk/include/**` are package data, because the generated C++ `#include`s the
headers at JIT time.

**Phase 6 is done: a DSL kernel becomes a `torch.ops.hk.*` op, and the SDPA
entry point is a drop-in.**

```python
import hk
from hk.ops import sdpa

sdpa.patch()                 # F.scaled_dot_product_attention -> hk, where it fits
torch.ops.hk.attn_fwd_d128(q, k, v, o)
```

`hk.torch_op(kernel)` emits a third scaffold beside `pybind` and `bare`, builds
it with plain `hipcc -shared -fPIC` and loads it with `torch.ops.load_library`
-- not `cpp_extension.load`, which would hipify source that is already HIP. The
schema is derived from the IR rather than from the author: `written_tensors`
walks the ops that write memory the caller can see (`store_global`,
`store_scalar`, `group_store`, and deliberately not `store_frag`, which writes
a shared tile), and those tensors become `Tensor(a!)` out-parameters. A schema
that forgets to mark an output mutable compiles, loads, runs, and is wrong only
under `torch.compile`'s functionalization -- which is exactly the kind of bug a
derivation removes and a convention does not.

It costs nothing. Same process, interleaved, bit-identity checked before timing
(`tools/hk-bench/sdpa_paths.py`); `aotriton` is the backend torch's own SDPA
picks on this chip, and is the thing being replaced:

```

```

Device time is identical across the three hk paths, which is what the shared
kernel body predicts. The surprise is the host column: torch's dispatcher is
*cheaper* than the pybind converter it replaces (3.1 us against 3.8), so the
registration is not a tax even on a 60 us elementwise op. The drop-in's 9.4 us
is the entry point's own work -- the support check and the output allocation --
and is the price of being callable as `F.scaled_dot_product_attention`.

Three details are load-bearing:

* **The kernel launches on torch's stream.** `cpp.py` now emits
  `launch_on(const globals&, hipStream_t)` with `launch(g)` as the default-stream
  wrapper, and the torch impl passes `getCurrentHIPStream()`. A default-stream
  launch breaks CUDA-graph capture and overlapped copies, silently.
* **`TORCH_LIBRARY_FRAGMENT`, not `TORCH_LIBRARY`.** Every kernel is its own
  `.so` and they share one namespace; the non-fragment form claims the namespace
  exclusively, and the second `.so` to load throws.
* **A `Meta` implementation** makes the op traceable by `torch.compile`. It is a
  no-op, because the op allocates nothing -- which is also what a serving
  framework wants.

`hk.integration` patches a running vLLM or SGLang. It rebinds **by identity**,
not by name: `_common.rebind` walks `sys.modules` under a prefix and replaces
every attribute that *is* `torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention`,
which catches the modules that did `from torch.nn.functional import ...` at
import time and cannot be fooled by a same-named impostor. `python3 -m
hk.integration --warm -j 32` fills the cache for the torch half specifically:
libtorch's include and ABI flags are part of the cache key, so a `--aot` pass
built for pybind does not spare a server its first attention compile.

Two things are deliberately *not* patched, and the reason is the same both
times -- the patch would be slower than what it replaces:

* **RMSNorm.** Every framework's RMSNorm applies a learned weight;
  `hk.ops.rmsnorm` is unweighted, so the patch would add an elementwise pass to
  save one.
* **SiLU-mul.** `SiluAndMul` slices one `(..., 2d)` tensor into two
  non-contiguous halves and `hk.ops.silu_mul` has no stride support, so the
  patch would add two copies to save one pass.

Both are written down as missing *kernel* work rather than attempted as
patches.

**What the patch can and cannot reach in vLLM**, read against vLLM at 1dfe9fb
and checked at runtime by `hk.integration.vllm.probe()`:

* **The decoder's attention is out of reach, structurally.** vLLM V1 keeps KV
  in a paged cache and dispatches through `AttentionImpl.forward(..., kv_cache,
  block_table, ...)` -- `RocmAttentionImpl` or `TritonAttentionImpl` on this
  chip. There is no dense `(B, H, N, D)` tensor on that path for an SDPA
  drop-in to intercept. Reaching it needs a *paged* kernel registered through
  `vllm.v1.attention.backends.registry.register_backend`, which is kernel work
  `hk.ops.attn` has not done.
* **The vision tower's attention is in reach, exactly.**
  `mm_encoder_attention._forward_sdpa` -> `torch.ops.vllm.torch_sdpa_wrapper`
  -> `apply_sdpa` is a literal `F.scaled_dot_product_attention` on a dense
  `(B, H, N, D)` tensor, and patching `F` reaches it because the attribute is
  resolved on the module at call time.
* **It is not the default on RDNA3.** `RocmPlatform.get_vit_attn_backend`
  prefers the Triton flash-attention whenever `flash_attn_triton_available()`;
  `--mm-encoder-attn-backend TORCH_SDPA` selects it deliberately, and that is a
  supported configuration rather than a trick.

An earlier version of this file said `VLLM_ATTENTION_BACKEND=TORCH_SDPA` was
the lever for the decode path. That was wrong twice over: the variable no
longer exists in current vLLM, and `AttentionBackendEnum.TORCH_SDPA` carries
the comment "this tag is only used for ViT".

Measured on the exact call the ViT path makes -- `(b, s, h, d)` permuted to
`(b, h, s, d)`, so never contiguous -- against aotriton on a W7900D:

`hk.ops.attn` has head_dim 64 and 128, so CLIP-L/14 (LLaVA, Pixtral,
InternViT) fits and SigLIP's 72 and Qwen2-VL's 80 fall back. The fallback rows
are the reason this table exists: the first measurement of them was 0.84x and
0.90x, because `scaled_dot_product_attention` copied `q`, `k` and `v`
contiguous *before* asking whether the kernel could take them -- three copies
thrown away, and torch handed the original strided tensors anyway. Deciding
first and memoising the verdict took it to 0.95x and 0.97x, the remainder
being the Python predicate itself on a 0.19 ms call.

The drop-in now counts which branch it took (`hk.ops.sdpa.STATS`), because a
patch that silently falls back produces identical answers and no speedup,
which is indistinguishable from one that works unless something counts.

`tools/hk-bench/vllm_verify.py` is the verification, and it has now been run
inside a real vLLM (0.16.1.dev0, ROCm 7.2.1, W7900D) serving
`OpenGVLab/InternVL2-2B` with `--mm-encoder-attn-backend TORCH_SDPA`. The
engine reaches the kernel: **120 kernel calls, 0 fallbacks** over five
requests, which is 24 InternViT layers each, and the server answers normally.

Getting there found two failures that nothing short of a live engine would
have shown, both of which looked like success:

* **vLLM V1 runs the model in a spawned process.** `apply()` in the process
  that built `LLM(...)` patches a process the model never runs in. The first
  end-to-end run reported `{'kernel': 0, 'fallback': 0}` with byte-identical
  answers and a plausible-looking 1.001x. Production therefore needs the
  `vllm.general_plugins` entry point (`hk/integration/_vllm_plugin.py`), which
  vLLM loads in the driver *and* every worker; it is opt-in on
  `HK_PATCH_VLLM=1`, because installing a kernel library must not silently
  change the numerics of every vLLM on the machine.
* **The vision tower runs once per distinct image.** With
  `mm_processor_cache` and prefix caching on, a warm-up request consumed the
  only ViT pass and every later request was served from cache -- counters at
  zero again, for a different reason.

And one measurement was wrong until a control caught it. Running the arms in
blocks gave "1.18x end to end"; running the *same* arm twice under a different
ViT backend gave 1.16x with the kernel never called at all. The order effect
was the whole number. Interleaved, the end-to-end spread is +-25% on a ~250 ms
request of which the vision tower is ~4 ms, so an end-to-end request simply
cannot resolve this -- the tower's own number is the `--unit` table above, and
`--e2e` is a correctness and reachability check that now says so.

**And it found a real bug, which is now fixed.** Patched, InternVL2-2B
described the test image differently from unpatched -- while the unpatched run
repeated itself exactly, and vLLM's Triton flash-attention ViT backend agreed
with unpatched word for word. Two independent implementations agreeing and
ours disagreeing is the shape of a bug, so `tools/hk-bench/attn_precision.py`
went after it. Three hypotheses died first:

* **not** the non-dividing KV tail: `hk/torch` was the same 1.5-2.4x at
  N = 512, 544, 576, 608, 1024, 1056 as at 577, 578, 1000, 1025, 1026;
* **not** an artifact of the reference: torch's flash, mem-efficient and math
  backends all land within 3e-6 of each other here;
* **not** concentrated: p50, p90 and p99 were each ~2.5x torch's with the
  worst rows scattered, which is rounding and not a mishandled block.

Emulating the kernel's own algorithm in torch then ruled out the algorithm:
with the probability tile rounded to bf16, a 32-wide KV block and a 1-ulp
exp2, the emulation landed on *torch's* number exactly, not the kernel's. So
the kernel was not doing what its algorithm said.

The probe that found it has an exact answer. Set `V` to all ones: the softmax
weights sum to one, so attention must return exactly 1.0 for every element,
whatever Q and K were. torch returned exactly 1.0. **This kernel returned 1.0
off by 2^-8 -- one whole bf16 ulp -- on every element.**

`convertor<bf16, float>` in `include/rdna3/common/base_types.cuh` was
`bit_cast<uint32_t>(u) >> 16`, labelled "fast unsafe conversion (truncation
only)". Truncation toward zero is *biased*, half an ulp, always the same
direction -- and attention rounds a tile of positive probabilities through it
on every KV block while summing the fp32 ones for the denominator, so the bias
does not cancel. It accumulates into the ratio.

Rounding instead of truncating closes it completely. Measured, four ways in
one process (`tools/hk-bench/bf16_round_cost.py`), cost on attention at
head_dim 128 / 64:

```
0  truncate             1 instr      --          biased; not a supported mode
1  nearest, ties away   2 instr   +2.1% / +3.4%  unbiased          <- default
2  nearest even         3 instr   +3.5% / +6.4%  unbiased
3  nearest even + NaN   5 instr   +6.0% / +12.5% unbiased and total
```

GEMM pays 0.2% in every mode, because its conversion is once per output
element rather than once per probability. No mode changes the register count
(215 / 217 / 147 VGPRs, zero scratch, all four).

The default is ties-away: it is the cheapest unbiased rounding there is, and
it is **numerically indistinguishable from the expensive one** here -- `V = 1`
returns exactly 1.0, and hk's error against fp32 is now `1.00x` torch's at
every N in the sweep, not 1.5-2.4x. The NaN guard doubles the cost to protect
against a value attention cannot produce, so it is opt-in
(`-DHK_BF16_ROUND=3`); without it a NaN whose low mantissa bits are near
all-ones can come back as an infinity.

Two tests now hold the line, both with exact answers rather than a tolerance
(`tests/hk/gpu/test_attn.py`): `V = 1` must come back bit-exact, and `Q = 0`
must give the mean of V. The file's existing `RTOL = 5e-2` could never have
seen this -- it is sized to catch a shifted mask, and a half-ulp bias passed
all 31 of its cases while changing what a model said.

**What is left is a tie, and it was measured rather than assumed.** hk and
aotriton now differ on 0.02-0.04% of the vision tower's output elements, by
exactly one bf16 ulp -- two correctly-rounded kernels breaking ties from
different intermediates, which is as close as independent implementations get.
Whether that changes a caption is a property of how close the model's top two
tokens were, so the e2e runs six images under all three implementations:

```
image   aotriton (TORCH_SDPA)      Triton FA        hk
  1     "mosaic of shapes"         same             "crowd of people"
  2     "mosaic of shapes"         same             same
  3     "crowd of people"          same             same
  4     "crowd of people"          "digital noise"  "digital noise"
  5     "blurred and distorted"    same             same
  6     "shades of green, red"     same             same
```

vLLM's own two backends already disagree with each other on 1 of 6; hk
disagrees with aotriton on 2 of 6, and on one of those (image 4) it agrees
with Triton FA *against* aotriton. Each arm repeated itself 6/6, so the engine
is deterministic and these are real disagreements -- between three
implementations, on inputs chosen to be maximally ambiguous (synthetic noise).
hk is inside the spread that already exists between shipped backends, not
outside it. A real-image benchmark would say more; this says enough to stop
treating the remaining difference as a defect.

The layer underneath is covered by the GPU tier -- 225 tests including
`torch.compile(fullgraph=True)`, CUDA-graph capture and replay, and the
strided-ViT-input contract in both directions.

`python3 -m hk.integration --warm -j 32` builds the six distinct attention
registrations in 17.8 s, which is the number that matters for a server's first
request.

**Phase 7: the decoder, which the SDPA patch structurally could not reach.**
vLLM V1 keeps KV in a paged cache and dispatches through `AttentionImpl`, so
the way in is to *be* a backend. `hk/ops/paged.py` is the kernel and
`hk/integration/vllm_backend.py` registers it.

The cache layout decides the kernel. `gl` derives its strides from its dims,
so vLLM's default `(block, token, head, dim)` cannot yield a contiguous
`(block_size, head_dim)` tile for one head. A backend declares its own shape,
so this one declares `(2, num_blocks, num_kv_heads, block_size, head_size)` --
exactly `gl`'s `(b, d, r, c)`, so one page of one head is a plain tile load.
The price is that the cache *update* becomes a strided scatter, and that is
the right way round: a decode step reads `seq_len` pages per layer and writes
one.

**It loses, and an earlier version of this file said it won.** That claim came
from Qwen3-0.6B, four short prompts, measured as total wall time. Total wall
time mixes prefill with decode and is neither latency nor throughput, and a
0.6B model spends so little of a step in attention that the number was mostly
measuring something else. Retracted.

The measurement that means something isolates one decode step. Each point runs
the same requests at two output lengths and takes the *slope*,
`(T(72) - T(8)) / 64`, which cancels prefill and every other fixed cost.

eager, three reps per endpoint, `tools/hk-bench/vllm_sweep.py`:

```

Measurement bands were under 1% of the value at every point except hk at
ctx 1024 batch 1, so the ordering is not in question.

**Why, in one number.** Going from 1024 to 4096 tokens of context at batch 1
costs Triton **+0.97 ms/step** and this kernel **+28.2 ms/step**. That extra
3072 tokens is 12.6 MB of K and V per layer, so per layer:

```
triton   0.027 ms   469 GB/s    54% of the W7900D's 864 GB/s
hk       0.785 ms    16 GB/s     1.9%
```

Decode attention is a bandwidth problem and this kernel is getting 2% of the
bandwidth. The cause is the limitation already written down when it was built:
**no split along the KV axis**. One workgroup per (request, kv head) means
batch 1 launches 8 workgroups of one warp each on a 48-WGP GPU, and they walk
the whole context serially. Triton splits the KV range across the machine.

That also explains the shape of the whole table. hk is nearly flat in batch --
54.4 ms at batch 1, 59.2 at batch 32 -- because at low batch the GPU is idle
and extra requests fill it for free. Triton starts near the bandwidth limit
and degrades as requests compete for it (42.0 -> 61.5). The two cross at
batch 32, which is the only cell hk wins, and it wins it by 4%.

**Splitting the KV axis closes most of it.** `paged_decode_split_kernel` cuts
the page range `splits` ways and writes a partial `(O, m, l)` per split;
`merge_splits` combines them. How many ways was measured rather than reasoned
(`tools/hk-bench/paged_splits.py`, fifteen shapes), and the first guess was
wrong by an order of magnitude: the best split at every point puts
`n_reqs * n_kv_heads * splits` near **a thousand** workgroups, not the 96 that
"two per WGP" suggests -- which is the right instinct for a twelve-warp
workgroup and wrong for a one-warp one. At batch 16 the old rule asked for one
split, i.e. 128 workgroups of a single warp each walking 128 pages in series.

```

4096     16    91.74   91.29     64.54     56.78   1.14x
```

Worst case 1.92x -> 1.19x. Standalone, the kernel now reaches 56% of the
card's 864 GB/s at ctx 4096 batch 16 and 76% at ctx 16384 batch 32, against
1.9% before.

**And the remaining gap is flat, which says what it is.** 1.14-1.19x at every
shape is not a kernel that is uniformly slower -- a kernel-speed difference
would grow with context, as the 1.92x did. It is a constant ~7-9 ms per step,
or ~0.2 ms per layer, and the backend's `forward` issues about a dozen small
torch ops per layer around the kernel: the query pad copy, the output copy,
two scatters for the cache update, and six or seven elementwise passes in
`merge_splits`. At ROCm's launch cost that is the whole difference. It is the
same class of mistake as the `.tolist()` that made the first version slower
than Triton, one level down.

So: the kernel is no longer the problem and the wrapper is. Folding the merge
and the cache update into kernels, and keeping the pad and the output copy out
of the per-layer path, is what the next round has to do -- and the flatness of
that column is the evidence that it is worth doing.

Four facts about vLLM's plugin surface are written down in
`vllm_backend.py` because each cost a run to find: `AttentionBackendEnum` is
closed and `register_backend` overrides rather than adds; the reserved
`CUSTOM` member is rejected by `RocmPlatform`'s allowlist, so the override has
to target a member the platform accepts (`TRITON_ATTN`, which is also ROCm's
default -- hence the separate `HK_VLLM_BACKEND=1` opt-in); `get_name()` must
answer with the member it overrides because vLLM round-trips the name through
the enum; and short prompts cannot use the dense kernel and cannot be padded
into it, because zero-padded keys are not masked out, they are keys with score
zero and `exp(0)` is a real weight in the softmax sum.

Scope, stated rather than discovered: no paged *prefill* kernel, so prefix
caching and chunked prefill are refused rather than silently attending over
part of a context; and no split along the KV axis, so one workgroup per
(request, kv head) walks the whole sequence and the machine is under-used at
low batch. Both are the next measurable steps.

See `.claude/plans/` for the full plan and its gates.
