"""What wraps the kernel: the module boundary.

Split from cpp.py because the kernel body is the same artifact in every
deployment and only its wrapper changes. A pybind module is what `hk.compile()`
loads; a TORCH_LIBRARY registration is what vLLM and SGLang want (Phase 6); an
AOT build wants neither, just the object file. Keeping this in one place means
those three share a single emitter and cannot drift.

The module name is a macro rather than a literal because the compiled artifact
is named after its content hash, and pybind requires PYBIND11_MODULE's name to
match the .so's basename exactly -- get that wrong and the import fails with
"dynamic module does not define module export function", which says nothing
about the real cause.

    would have to guess. Taking the destination as an argument also happens to

      form claims the namespace exclusively and the second .so to load throws.
    * The stream is torch's current stream, not the default stream. On the
      default stream the kernel is ordered against nothing torch did.
    * A `Meta` implementation, so the op can be traced by torch.compile. It is
      a no-op because the op allocates nothing: with the outputs passed in,
