"""Attention over a paged KV cache -- the decode half.

vLLM V1 does not keep K and V as dense `(B, H, N, D)` tensors. It keeps them
in fixed-size pages and hands the kernel a *page table*: `block_table[req][i]`
is where request `req`'s i-th page lives. There is no contiguous tensor on
that path, which is why an SDPA drop-in cannot reach a decoder however it is
configured, and why this file exists.

**The layout is ours, and that is the point.** `gl`'s strides are derived from
its dims, so a `(block, token, head, dim)` cache -- vLLM's default -- cannot
produce a contiguous `(block_size, head_dim)` tile for one head. Since a
backend declares its own `get_kv_cache_shape`, this one declares

    (num_blocks, num_kv_heads, block_size, head_dim)

which is exactly `gl`'s `(b, d, r, c)`, so one page of one head is a plain
tile load. The cost is that the cache update becomes a strided scatter instead
of a contiguous one -- and that is the right way round, because a decode step
*reads* `seq_len` pages per layer and *writes* one. The read is thousands of
times the traffic.

**Page size is the KV block.** `KV_BLOCK` here is the cache's page size rather
than a tiling choice, so one loop iteration is one page and the within-page
offset is always zero. vLLM's ROCm backends offer 16 and 32; 32 is what the
dense kernel already uses.

What this does not do, deliberately, in its first form: no split across the KV
axis (one workgroup per (request, kv head), walking the whole sequence), and
no prefill. Both are measurable next steps rather than guesses -- see
`python/README.md`.

    the only way to use the bandwidth is to put the machine on it.

    Each workgroup produces a *partial* softmax over its page range: the
    unnormalised O, the running max m, and the running sum l. It does not
    divide, because a split's l is not the sequence's l. `merge_splits` below
    combines them.

    `splits` is a constexpr rather than a grid dimension read from a tensor,

    # The numerator and the denominator take *different* weights, and getting
    # that wrong is the whole difficulty of a split softmax. O_s is already a
    # sum of (probability x V) under split s's own maximum, so rescaling it to
    # the global maximum takes exp2(m_s - m) and nothing else; l_s is a sum of
    # those same probabilities and takes the same factor. Weighting O by
    # exp2(m_s - m) * l_s -- which is what this did first -- multiplies every
    # numerator by its split's sum a second time. The weights still sum to
    # something, so the answer looks like an answer: 77x off, not NaN.
