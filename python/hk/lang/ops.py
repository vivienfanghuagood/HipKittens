"""Tile ops.

Each one records an Op and returns a Value. The names mirror
include/rdna3/ops/warp -- `row_max` here is `kittens::row_max` there -- so that
a kernel translated from C++ reads the same, and so that the emitter's job stays
a lookup rather than a translation.

Value-style (`c = a + b`) rather than the destination-passing style the C++ uses
(`add(c, a, b)`): the IR wants to know what is live, and destination-passing
hides that. The emitter turns values back into destinations when it writes C++.

    a double-buffered kernel that is always the opposite access -- outstanding

# The four variants are not four conveniences. gfx1100's WMMA takes its two
# operands in fixed fragment layouts, and which of the four names applies is
# decided by the layouts you already have -- so the choice of variant is how a
# kernel avoids a transpose, and picking the wrong one is how it buys eight
# ds_read_u16 per base tile instead of two ds_read_b128. See check_layouts.

# Every rule below is transcribed from the static_asserts in

# the alternative is a template instantiation error forty lines deep that names
